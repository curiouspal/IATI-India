In 2007 the organization initiated the Golden Weavers’ Project, an Ericulture livelihood project, with support from Sir Dorabji TataTrust. In order to ensure optimum benefits to the community, Grameen Sahara subsequently incorporated an Eri Silk Producer Company in 2011, which is owned and run by the producers themselves. The organization also promotes and implements System of Crop Intensification (SCI) and Diversion Based Irrigation (DBI) in various areas of Assam. Through its microfinance operations, Grameen Sahara currently reaches around 27,000 families in the area. 
Project overview: This project is implemented as part of a new Grameen Sahara program that aims to promote sustainable livelihoods for the poor through the provision of financial services, technical assistance and other development support services in integrated manner. The specific objectives are to: improve the pace and quality of life of the rural and urban poor especially the village and decentralized sector; focus attention on women, children, the historically disadvantaged scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, minorities and other marginalized communities for their economic self-sustenance; create, develop and support self employment avenues for rural and urban youth; build social capital that will be used by and for the community; and optimally utilize all the available natural, social, economic and other resources for the well being of the community. 
Project activities and outputs: The project aims to facilitate the organization of producer groups of women weavers and spinners to address common problems such marketing, publicity, product diversification, skills upgrading. It will also provide capacity development support in the field of design development as well as working capital assistance towards purchase of raw materials. To address the scarcity of cocoons during the lean seasons, Grameen Sahara will also maintain a stock of cocoons to meet the needs of spinners. As a result of these activities, the project aims to contribute to higher and more predictable income for home-based women producers due to increased production and product quality This is expected to enhance the self respect and status of women in the community. By providing a steady supply of cocoons, the project will also help safeguard producers against market price fluctuations.

Centre for Sustainable Agriculture is a professional resource organization engaged in establishing models of sustainable agriculture working in partnership with NGOs and Community Based Organizations by scaling up the successes and engaging with the establishment for a policy change. 

CSA believes in promoting sustainable agricultural technologies that are based on farmers’ knowledge and skills, their innovation based on local conditions and their use of nature’s products and processes to gain better control over the pre-production and production processes involved in agriculture. CSA works with farmers to conserve their resources and their rights.

Great initiatives that build on agricultural biodiversity to increase resilience in farming systems can be found all over the world, but often they do not change things at a larger scale. Why is that? Why don't they make a bigger difference? How can we make sure that they have greater impact? A better understanding is needed of the factors that enable the successful scaling up of positive change for more resilient farming systems.

Developing a conceptual framework and criteria on good practice for agro-biodiversity based resilient farming, identifying cases where such practices have successfully reached scale and analysing their preconditions and impact, can generate insights that can help these solutions to transform from local islands of success into strategies that are transferable to other places and other contexts.

The total cost of the 7 subprojects is estimated at Rs140.18 billion (or $2.92 billion), inclusive of taxes, duties, and interest and other charges on the loan during construction, against which IIFCL sanctioned Rs15.2 billion (or $316.27 million). The PFR3 is expected to catalyze 12 times of funding resources from the market.  

The requested loan of $240 million will be from ADB's ordinary capital resources under ADB's LIBOR-based lending facility with a 0.15% commitment charge and a 25-year term including grace period of 5 years, and such other terms agreed in the FFA and under the loan agreement. The last date on which any disbursement request under this tranche is expected to be made on 14 December 2014.

IIFCL's project management unit (PMU), established under the IIPFF I, will continue to monitor day-to-day implementation of Tranche III including the identification, screening, selection, and monitoring of all subprojects, including compliance with state and national policies and the environmental and social safeguard framework. The indicative 7 subprojects under the proposed PFR3 were selected based on commercial and technical viability in compliance with relevant national and ADB norms.

If this first stage of the project will be succesfull CED will apply further funding for two other 3-year continuation projects the aim of which is to replace also the remaining highly polluting stoves with SAI stoves (=extremely clean-burning stoves planned and designed by the world- famous improved stoves expert Saibashkar Nakka Reddy together with the SAI personnel). If the project and its continuation phases will succeed in replacing the 100 000 most polluting cooking stoves in the Greater Mumbai areas with SAI stoves this should both benefit the 100 000 poorest households in the area (because they will need less cooking energy) and improve the air quality in an area inhabited by more than 20 million people.  We do not have precise numbers but it seems likely (obvious) that the mentioned 100 000 highly polluting cooking stoves are responsible for a significant perecentage of all parcticulate emissions released into the air in the Greater Mumbai area. The 100 000 highly polluting stoves cannot be replaced with better stoves without subsidizing the production because they are used by the poorest households that cannot afford kerosene electricity or liquid gas and that have not this far even been able to invest in better coing stoves. According to our prior experience (based on 2 500 SAI stoves that have already been manufactured and sold for the poor households in Mumbai by SAI) the poor families will by and adopt improved clean-burning and energy-saving stoves if their price is reduced to an affordable level (from their perspective) with a subsidy of 5 or 5.5 euros per cooking stove. This means that might be possible to significantly improve the air quality in the Greater Mumbai region by investing 0.025 euros per inhabitant in subsidies on improved cooking stoves sold for the poor families.  Or at least SAI our cooperation partner in Mumbai thinks that it would be possible to achieve something like this with approximately 500 000 euros in 9-10 years.,,2014-03-13,2014-12-31,,,,,,,Finland,FI,,,Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland,FI-3,,,Social Activities Integration,22000,,,,,,41081,Environmental education/ training,,OECD Development Assistance Committee,DAC,1,,,,

The 100 000 highly polluting stoves cannot be replaced with better stoves without subsidizing the production because they are used by the poorest households that cannot afford kerosene electricity or liquid gas and that have not this far even been able to invest in better coing stoves. According to our prior experience (based on 2 500 SAI stoves that have already been manufactured and sold for the poor households in Mumbai by SAI) the poor families will by and adopt improved clean-burning and energy-saving stoves if their price is reduced to an affordable level (from their perspective) with a subsidy of 5 or 5.5 euros per cooking stove. This means that might be possible to significantly improve the air quality in the Greater Mumbai region by investing 0.025 euros per inhabitant in subsidies on improved cooking stoves sold for the poor families.  Or at least SAI our cooperation partner in Mumbai thinks that it would be possible to achieve something like this with approximately 500 000 euros in 9-10 years.,,2014-03-13,2014-12-31,,,,,,,Finland,FI,,,Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland,FI-3,,,Social Activities Integration,22000,,,,,,41081,Environmental education/ training,,OECD Development Assistance Committee,DAC,1,,,,

If this first stage of the project will be succesfull CED will apply further funding for two other 3-year continuation projects the aim of which is to replace also the remaining highly polluting stoves with SAI stoves (=extremely clean-burning stoves planned and designed by the world- famous improved stoves expert Saibashkar Nakka Reddy together with the SAI personnel).

The Initiative selected the first cohort of 24 grantees in East and West Africa through a competitive call in 2008-2009. A second competitive call was launched in 2009, targeting seven countries in Latin America and five countries in South Asia (Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka). Of the 16 successful applicants from South Asia, nine are in India.

Policy research in South Asia is dominated by India. A long tradition of independent research exists there thanks to the strong demand from policymakers in search  of ideas and advice. Local funding is available, but as in other regions, this tends to be project-based and is moving away from support to the social sciences. Institutions are struggling to maintain high quality research and to communicate their results effectively.

This grant will strengthen the ability of the nine research institutions in India to provide, disseminate and communicate high-quality research. It will do so through measures aimed at enhancing the ability of staff to conduct sound research, improving organizational performance and forging links with policymakers. Particular effort will be made to enable grantees to mobilize other sources of funding, so that none become dependent on the Think Tank Initiative over the long term. The project will also support a platform for grantee networking both within the Initiative and with a wider network of institutions engaged in policy-related research.

Policy research in South Asia is dominated by India. A long tradition of independent research exists there thanks to the strong demand from policymakers in search  of ideas and advice. Local funding is available, but as in other regions, this tends to be project-based and is moving away from support to the social sciences. Institutions are struggling to maintain high quality research and to communicate their results effectively.

This grant will strengthen the ability of the nine research institutions in India to provide, disseminate and communicate high-quality research. It will do so through measures aimed at enhancing the ability of staff to conduct sound research, improving organizational performance and forging links with policymakers. Particular effort will be made to enable grantees to mobilize other sources of funding, so that none become dependent on the Think Tank Initiative over the long term. The project will also support a platform for grantee networking both within the Initiative and with a wider network of institutions engaged in policy-related research.

It will do so through measures aimed at enhancing the ability of staff to conduct sound research, improving organizational performance and forging links with policymakers. Particular effort will be made to enable grantees to mobilize other sources of funding, so that none become dependent on the Think Tank Initiative over the long term. The project will also support a platform for grantee networking both within the Initiative and with a wider network of institutions engaged in policy-related research.

The Initiative selected the first cohort of 24 grantees in East and West Africa through a competitive call in 2008-2009. A second competitive call was launched in 2009, targeting seven countries in Latin America and five countries in South Asia (Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka). Of the 16 successful applicants from South Asia, nine are in India.

Policy research in South Asia is dominated by India. A long tradition of independent research exists there thanks to the strong demand from policymakers in search  of ideas and advice. Local funding is available, but as in other regions, this tends to be project-based and is moving away from support to the social sciences.

Jan Sahas Social Development Society (Jan Sahas) is an NGO working to ensure the rights and empowerment of marginalized communities, especially Dalits, in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. 

Jan Sahas follows a participatory approach while monitoring and responding to discrimination and atrocities against marginalized communities, increasing awareness about their rights, promoting local-level leadership, and forming community-based organizations (CBOs). Jan Sahas has formed four thematic CBOs: a Dalit collective; a women’s collective for elimination of manual scavenging as well as the rescue and rehabilitation of those forced into the practice; a women’s collective; and a children’s collective. In this project the focus lies on Dalits, in particular women and children.

From 2014 to 2016 Jan Sahas will be implementing 3 campaigns with the support of UUHHJIF and Hivos. The Campaign for Establishing Right to Land addresses the issue of land rights for Dalits and Tribal communities in Madhya Pradesh, who make up over 35 percent of the population, but hold only 7 percent of arable land in the region. Historically, these groups have been deprived of land rights, but it is believed that equal distribution of land paves the way for positive social and economical changes in the community. The Campaign builds on land reforms done in 2002, promising to make land available to Dalit and Tribal groups. Steps have been made, but research has shown that 60 percent of families face various types of problems, both legal and agricultural. The Campaign seeks to support these groups in resolving the issues.

The second Campaign addresses atrocities and violence against Dalits and Women, who suffer disproportionate levels of various forms of physical assault (including killings, rape, arson) in Madhya Pradesh. Many of these go unreported, primarily because of police reluctance to register them. Cases that are registered often remain uninvestigated.  The Campaign seeks to address these issue, through ensuring access to justice to victims, and by filing cases with different authorities. 

The third Campaign is against discrimination and social exclusion focusing on education. Studies have shown that Dalits in Madhya Pradesh, due to their “untouchability”, face exclusion from many public places, including schools. This leads to low literacy rates amongst the group, and, despite education being a fundamental right, only 64.7 percent of Dalit children between 5 and 14 goes to school. The Campaigns focuses amongst other on sensitization on Dalit and non-Dalit groups alike, policy dialogue with various stakeholder and community monitoring on exclusion from education.

These losses affect the livelihoods of nearly one-third of the population, the majority of which are smallholder farmers. Past research to increase post-harvest shelf life has focused primarily on keeping fruit firm, which is unsuitable for tropical fruits such as mangoes. 

This project brings together research partners from Canada and South Asia to develop a nanotechnology-based packaging system that will extend the shelf life of fruits, thus augmenting local food and livelihood security.

The nano-particles in this project are developed from agricultural waste products, namely the natural fibres extracted from coconut husks and banana plants, creating new income opportunities for small-scale entrepreneurs, particularly women. The project is also building links with the private sector for biodegradable packaging materials.

Researchers expect to adapt the technologies developed in this project to other economically important horticultural crops, including flowers, and vegetables. Benefits for the soft fruit industry, such as berries, can also be extended to Canada.

These losses affect the livelihoods of nearly one-third of the population, the majority of which are smallholder farmers. Past research to increase post-harvest shelf life has focused primarily on keeping fruit firm, which is unsuitable for tropical fruits such as mangoes. 

This project brings together research partners from Canada and South Asia to develop a nanotechnology-based packaging system that will extend the shelf life of fruits, thus augmenting local food and livelihood security.

The nano-particles in this project are developed from agricultural waste products, namely the natural fibres extracted from coconut husks and banana plants, creating new income opportunities for small-scale entrepreneurs, particularly women. The project is also building links with the private sector for biodegradable packaging materials.

Researchers expect to adapt the technologies developed in this project to other economically important horticultural crops, including flowers, and vegetables. Benefits for the soft fruit industry, such as berries, can also be extended to Canada.

Researchers expect to adapt the technologies developed in this project to other economically important horticultural crops, including flowers, and vegetables. Benefits for the soft fruit industry, such as berries, can also be extended to Canada.

Past research to increase post-harvest shelf life has focused primarily on keeping fruit firm, which is unsuitable for tropical fruits such as mangoes. 

This project brings together research partners from Canada and South Asia to develop a nanotechnology-based packaging system that will extend the shelf life of fruits, thus augmenting local food and livelihood security.

There was storm surge up to 3 meter height. Worst hit districts are Ganjam, Puri, Khurda, Cuttack, Jagatshingpur, Naygarh amongst the 17 affected districts in Orissa. Kalingapatnam, the adjacent district in the state of Andhra Pradesh was also affected by Cyclone Phailin.  Heavy rains brought by the cyclone Phailin that hit the coast on Saturday night led to flooding, causing a second crisis in Mayurbhanj, Balasore, Kendrapara, Bhadrak and Jajjpur district. The worst affected by flooding are the Balasore and Kendrapara district. Due to heavy precipitation, released water from the Hirakud dam has made the situation critical. Even as the life continued to remain out of gear in cyclone hit areas, the flood situation remained grim in 4 affected districts. There is full moon on 18th October; until then due to high tide the situation will remain worst. However, in Ganjam district, flood water has started receding since 16th October.

This Emergency Response is to provide immediate humanitarian assistance to decrease public health risks to 9750 cyclone-affected men women and children in Ganjam and Puri Districts through provision of water and sanitation facilities, public health services, emergency shelter and emergency food and livelihood assistance support by March 2013.
