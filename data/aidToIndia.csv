The Facility is an integral part of ADB's sector strategy and compliments ADB's parallel initiatives in public-private partnerships (PPPs), contractual savings, and capital markets-all of which contribute to creating an enabling environment for long-term financing for infrastructure development. 

A Framework Financing Agreement (FFA) was signed between Asian Development Bank (ADB), IIFCL, and the Government of India (the Government or the Guarantor) on 6 October 2009 for IIPFF II. On 17 November 2009, ADB's Board of Directors approved the MFF. Subsequently, the loan and guarantee agreements for the first tranche (Tranche I) amounting to $210 million were signed on 22 December 2009 by authorized signatories. The loan for Tranche I became effective as of 17 March 2010. The Facility Administration Memorandum was signed on 17 March 2010 between ADB and IIFCL. In February 2010, an environmental and social management unit (ESMU) was established which was a condition precedent for the loan effectiveness of Tranche 1. 

IIFCL requested ADB to approve the second tranche of IIPFF II. In this context, the IIFCL submitted the second periodic financing request (PFR2) dated (17 November 2010 [to be updated]) amounting to $250 million.

The total cost of the 7 subprojects is estimated at Rs140.18 billion (or $2.92 billion), inclusive of taxes, duties, and interest and other charges on the loan during construction, against which IIFCL sanctioned Rs15.2 billion (or $316.27 million). The PFR3 is expected to catalyze 12 times of funding resources from the market.  

The requested loan of $240 million will be from ADB's ordinary capital resources under ADB's LIBOR-based lending facility with a 0.15% commitment charge and a 25-year term including grace period of 5 years, and such other terms agreed in the FFA and under the loan agreement. The last date on which any disbursement request under this tranche is expected to be made on 14 December 2014.

IIFCL's project management unit (PMU), established under the IIPFF I, will continue to monitor day-to-day implementation of Tranche III including the identification, screening, selection, and monitoring of all subprojects, including compliance with state and national policies and the environmental and social safeguard framework. The indicative 7 subprojects under the proposed PFR3 were selected based on commercial and technical viability in compliance with relevant national and ADB norms. The tranche's loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). IIFCL requested retroactive financing for the PFR3. Except as otherwise agreed with ADB, it is proposed that the total eligible expenditure under retroactive financing will not exceed an amount equivalent to 20% of the individual loan and must have been incurred not more than 12 months before signing of the related legal agreements.","3","2012-03-21","2014-12-14","2012-03-21","2014-05-14","India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited","LN2822",NA,NA,"Asian Development Bank","46004","Multilateral",40,NA,NA,NA,NA,"India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited","LN2822",NA,NA,"IN","India",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Reporting Organisation (i.e. maintained by the organisation referred to in the <reporting-org> element.","RO",2,"411",10,"C01","5","USD",NA,2.4e+08,"239999999.98","0","0",3337244.39,0,0

Cyclone Phailin, categorised as 'very severe' by the India Meteorological Department and one of the most severe cyclones in recent years, made landfall on the eastern coast of India on the evening of 12th October 2013. It has been reported that 8 million people have been affected and more than 200,000 rural houses have been partially or fully damaged. 
 
Caritas India are providing immediate short term recovery support to 2000 families in nearly 80 villages under the 4 most affected blocks of the two districts of Ganjam and Mayurbhanj. People in these districts are currently living under the open sky, have lost important household materials and face numerous threats to their health including the potential outbreak of water borne diseases and are lacking food and nutritional security and health service support. Caritas India's focus will be to provide: 
1. Temporary shelter and non food (mats, blankets and mosquito nets) support. 
2. WATSAN and health support. Also medical assistance to the affected population through coordination with specialised actors/ services. 
3. Livelihood restoration through support of fishing nets, equipments, agriculture input support. 
4. Conditional cash transfer: Caritas India would provide cash in return for fulfilling specific requirements such as repair of individual/ community assets or enrolling their children in school. This would enable a sense of ownership with dignity rather than depending on external assistance. 
5. DRR awareness. 
6. Coordination and networking with Govt/state response forum for shelter support through IAY (Indira Awaas Yojana - Indian Government social welfare programme).

Fida partners with the Full Gospel Churches of India (FGCI). The work concentrates on the poorest communities in the vulnerable coastal region where most families get their income from agriculture labour and fishing. The main approach of the programme is that of Community Health Education (CHE). Through the programme the village communities gain courage as well as practical tools and know-how for developing their own communities. For instance, Community Health Educators are trained and self-help groups formed in each village, and youth (men and women) are trained in vocational skills. As the people in the villages learn new skills and are encouraged to take initiative, they become willing and able to develop their own communities. And as they begin to take action, the quality of life in the communities improves. In several villages the increased attitude of self-help has already led to a great deal of improvements in e.g. children’s school attendance, adult literacy, livelihood skills and means, and prevention of common diseases.",NA,"2007-03-15","2012-12-31",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Finland","FI","",NA,"Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland","FI-3","",NA,"Finnish NGO, Fida International","22000",NA,NA,"IN","India",NA,NA,NA,NA,"16050","Multisector aid for basic social services",NA,"OECD Development Assistance Committee","DAC",1,NA,NA,"",NA,"EUR","EUR",0,"55818","0","0",0,0,0

The on-going training programme is a direct result of the partners’ own call for assistance and support to help them to independently do community development work. One indicator of the programme’s success is the excellent team spirit that exists between the partners at all levels. Through this programme the partners gain professional know-how and tools for implementing community development projects as well as training at various levels. Special attention is paid to motivating the partners towards working with the most vulnerable and disadvantaged people groups within their society.

Special attention is paid to motivating the partners towards working with the most vulnerable and disadvantaged people groups within their society.

A broader goal is to empower and improve the local Dalit families as well as the socioeconomic standing of female artisans affiliated to the RAWHAAN group and to plan together with them a sustainable development programme for Haldipada. The structure which is the target of the project is needed as a location for work training meetings storage and shelter. The workspace will allow the villagers to carry out their basketware handicrafts in a much better environment than outdoors or in confined interiors. The community centre space will make it possible to provide education for example and human working conditions throughout the year. In addition to the provision of the building the application includes renovation of existing village buildings and their adaptation to the demanding local weather conditions.

However they remain marginalized in terms of access to health services information on sexual and reproductive health and power to make informed decisions regarding their own wellbeing. This translates into poor health and development indicators.This project has the overall objective of improving young people's access to health information and services in the selected Indian districts (Gazipur and Varanasi rural districts in the state of Uttar Pradesh and Bangalore rural district in the state of Karnataka). The project aims to support the state and district governments in establishing health services for adolescents. The project also aims to support the local communities in promoting young people's health with emphasis on gender equity and empowerment of marginalized youth.It is recognized that cultural and socio-economic barriers can prevent young people from seeking health services and that special youth friendly approaches can assist in overcoming these. Special Youth Clinics have been recently established in the intervention areas as the result of previous collaboration between PSR-Finland and MAMTA-HIMC. However the current services have a limited ability to reach out to the village level necessitating the development of new approaches.The activities of the proposed project comprise (1) provision of health information through schools and dedicated Youth Information Centers in the rural communities (2) training of outreach workers teachers and peer educators to address young people's health concerns (3) raising awareness of village district and state level stakeholders and (4) impact evaluation monitoring and documentation.The services will be established within the existing public health infrastructure. Community-based activities aim to strengthen the capacity of current actors such as Panchyati Raj Institutions Village Health and Sanitation Committees and schools. The approach is in line with Indian national policies such as the Adolescent Reproductive and Sexual Health Strategy.The main beneficiaries of the intervention are the young people whose health is critical to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals 2 4 5 and 6. Other beneficiaries of the project are teachers the other community members and functionaries of the public health system whose capacity to work with young people will be improved.",NA,"2012-11-15","2013-12-31",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Finland","FI","",NA,"Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland","FI-3","",NA,"MAMTA - Health Institute for Mother and Child","22000",NA,NA,"IN","India",NA,NA,NA,NA,"13020","Reproductive health care",NA,"OECD Development Assistance Committee","DAC",1,NA,NA,"",NA,"EUR","EUR",283353,"0","0","0",0,0,0

In this project planning phase the information about the project target areas and their inhabitants are collected for making a more detailed plan for the next project phases. The planning is implemented in cooperation with local residents. The target groups are women and young people which are tried to find new income opportunities in the field of sustainable development.The project employs one person from each organization. Vigyan Vijay Foundation (VVF) working in West Delhi slum and Innovative Institute for Development and Education of All (IIDEA) North Delhi slum. Each organization is well connected with the residents of those areas. Organisations project personnel will collect information on environmental health problems and are connected with target groups to motivate them to actively participate the project.The Integrated Sustainable Energy and Ecological Development Association (INSEDA) which is also the main local partner is responsible for the environmental technical expertise of the project. In addition the applicant organization ASDA Finnish Association is involved in the project data collection analysing the results planning ot the next phases and monitoring.The main technical challenge in this phase is to develop a demonstration and test unit of mobile  biogas plant which processes organic waste from vegetable markets and produces gas for the local residents. This is a new innovation. It is important that the biogas plant is movable because the space for there is not space for the permanent solutions. Slums are located next to the vegetable markets. The markets generate a huge amount of organic waste that is landfilled and produce large amounts of methane. When handling waste biogas power plant the slurry will be dried and biogas compressed to cylinders which local residents can take advantage as cooking gas.The project also employes part-time doctor who discuss with the target groups on environmental health problems and offer them possibility for health advices and consultations for example once a week in the both project areas.",NA,"2013-12-03","2014-12-31",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Finland","FI","",NA,"Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland","FI-3","",NA,"Aar Social Development Association ry","22000",NA,NA,"IN","India",NA,NA,NA,NA,"23030","Power generation/renewable sources",NA,"OECD Development Assistance Committee","DAC",1,NA,NA,"",NA,"EUR","EUR",20000,"0","0","0",0,0,0

If this first stage of the project will be succesfull CED will apply further funding for two other 3-year continuation projects the aim of which is to replace also the remaining highly polluting stoves with SAI stoves (=extremely clean-burning stoves planned and designed by the world- famous improved stoves expert Saibashkar Nakka Reddy together with the SAI personnel). If the project and its continuation phases will succeed in replacing the 100 000 most polluting cooking stoves in the Greater Mumbai areas with SAI stoves this should both benefit the 100 000 poorest households in the area (because they will need less cooking energy) and improve the air quality in an area inhabited by more than 20 million people.  We do not have precise numbers but it seems likely (obvious) that the mentioned 100 000 highly polluting cooking stoves are responsible for a significant perecentage of all parcticulate emissions released into the air in the Greater Mumbai area. The 100 000 highly polluting stoves cannot be replaced with better stoves without subsidizing the production because they are used by the poorest households that cannot afford kerosene electricity or liquid gas and that have not this far even been able to invest in better coing stoves. According to our prior experience (based on 2 500 SAI stoves that have already been manufactured and sold for the poor households in Mumbai by SAI) the poor families will by and adopt improved clean-burning and energy-saving stoves if their price is reduced to an affordable level (from their perspective) with a subsidy of 5 or 5.5 euros per cooking stove. This means that might be possible to significantly improve the air quality in the Greater Mumbai region by investing 0.025 euros per inhabitant in subsidies on improved cooking stoves sold for the poor families.  Or at least SAI our cooperation partner in Mumbai thinks that it would be possible to achieve something like this with approximately 500 000 euros in 9-10 years.",NA,"2014-03-13","2014-12-31",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Finland","FI","",NA,"Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland","FI-3","",NA,"Social Activities Integration","22000",NA,NA,"IN","India",NA,NA,NA,NA,"41081","Environmental education/ training",NA,"OECD Development Assistance Committee","DAC",1,NA,NA,"",NA,"EUR","EUR",55410,"55410","0","0",0,0,0

The main approach of the programme is that of Community Health Education (CHE). Through the programme the village communities gain courage as well as practical tools and know-how for developing their own communities. For instance_ Community Health Educators are trained and self-help groups formed in each village_ and youth (men and women) are trained in vocational skills. As the people in the villages learn new skills and are encouraged to take initiative_ they become willing and able to develop their own communities. And as they begin to take action_ the quality of life in the communities improves. In several villages the increased attitude of self-help has already led to a great deal of improvements in e.g. childrenâs school attendance_ adult literacy_ livelihood skills and means_ and prevention of common diseases.","2","2007-03-15","2009-12-31",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Finland","FI","Government",10,"Ministry of Foreign Affairs","FI-3","Government",10,"NATIONAL NGOs","22000",NA,NA,"IN","India",NA,NA,NA,NA,"16050","Multisector aid for basic social services",NA,"OECD Development Assistance Committee","DAC",1,"110",10,"","4","USD","",237137,"172985","0","0",0,0,0

It became an independent community-based organisation in August 2003 by registering itself under the Societies Registration Act. Jana Sahayog believes that people living in slums, by their very experiences, understand their problems best, and they themselves have the capabilities to arrive at solutions. It has now transformed as an organization that is managed and led by people living in slums. In 2002, the amendment of the Slum Act paved the way for people living in slums to organize themselves to achieve positive results for change.

The program stems from the context of steady withdrawal of the State from its responsibility to provide entitlements to all citizens irrespective of social, economic, and ethnicity.  The privatisation of agencies providing basic necessities of health, food, shelter, education and security, and the urban poor communities being steadily being pushed to impoverishment, loss of control over their meagre resources and deprivation on all fronts. The State’s treatment of the urban poor is characterised by insufficient political will, rampant corruption and top-down approach of planning with complete ignorance of the ground realities. The emerging political climate in the country that sees new alignment of dominant caste-class forces coupled with the new economic trend of liberalisation and privatisation, has further alienated the urban poor from the development that the country claims in the global arena. Combined with acute agrarian crisis, destruction of traditional livelihoods and large scale appropriation of resources has further pushed the marginalised communities towards destruction. The above scenario is very relevant for the state of Karnataka which has developed and marketed as one of the most lucrative destinations for foreign investment, albeit the lack of pro-poor development. 

The most prominent strategy of the project is to empower the affected people, the residents of urban community in this case, with the goal to enable people living in slums to come out of social discrimination, deprivation and to uphold multi-cultural social justice and caste-lessness through their own fora. The specific objectives are as follows: to create conducive atmosphere for enhancing awareness and conscientisize deprived communities; to enable the youth from deprived communities to become aware of their role in society by taking leadership role; to strengthen people’s institution of deprived communities; and to facilitate conducive atmosphere for integrating and promoting culture of deprived communities. Towards these ends, activities like organization and mobilization of workers, to include unorganized workers, temporary labourers, street vendors, and other marginalized workers’ groups into the peoples institution; seminars, lobby on state and central policies affecting the deprived communities; research on peoples culture and traditions of Karnataka; and identifying and promoting slum culture which is term used to define the people’s culture—will be undertaken. This project is being supported by ICCO as it fits well with its program for the region on grassroots democratization.

Malnutrition also increases during early childhood, particularly for girls, reflecting persistent social discrimination against girl child (National Family Health Survey-NFHS-2 in 1998-99 and NFHS-3, 2005-06). Government of India suggests that 79% children are suffering from Anaemia and 46% children are undernourished. 36% of both rural and urban Indians live below the poverty line according to the calorie intake (Tendulkar Committee Report, 2009). World Bank estimates 380 million people are living below the poverty line (2010).

The project goal is to improve access to food and food resources for selected groups whose right to food have been violated. This program will focus on documentation and monitoring of right to food violation cases. Aim and FIAN in India have already been successful in contributing to the ongoing struggles of the right to food, nutrition, work, land, social security and forest movements in the country and have also developed a strong organisational structure. FIAN India has documented violations of the right to food and elaborated a parallel report on the status of implementation of the right to food in India, which has been submitted to the UN in May 2008, and the officers of the president, prime minister and the commissioners in India.

Through this project AIM & FIAN can peruse the Indian Government to expedite cases and projects within the target timeframe. The beneficiaries of this project will include the vulnerable and marginalised communities living in India, who are the victims of violations of the right to food and living under chronic food insecurity circumstances, particularly women and children; CBOs (Community Based Organizations) and CSOs (Civil Society Organizations) working closely with these vulnerable communities are another group of key actors targeted; government agencies, parliamentarians, politicians and national and international human rights institutions in particular the National Human Rights Commission, Food Commissioners of Supreme Court, the judiciary/ lawyers; and different stakeholders are being targeted as key actors and supporters. ICCO’s  Food & Nutrition Security Programme for India and its support to this project will be meaningful to the marginalised communities in India as it will pave way for them to have improved food security.

The center’s flagship Participatory Watershed Development Program, which has been implemented since 1986 in Anantapur district, is perhaps the largest participatory watershed programme by an NGO in India. The program is implemented in more than 300 villages, covering about 1.35 lakh ha of farm land and 60,000 farmers, and disseminates a range of ecologically sound practices including soil and moisture conservation, rain water harvesting, horticulture and biogas production, as well as the institutional development of community organizations, and gender and social equity. Since 2007, AF has focused on promoting sustainable agriculture and has been a leading voice in calling for a favorable policy environment to support people-centered watershed development and rural employment in the state of Andhra Pradesh. This project focuses on the drought prone and semi-arid district of Ananttpur, where malnutrition, illiteracy, lack of access to healthcare and other basic services, and caste and gender discrimination, are higher than the state average. Due to the difficulty of earning a livelihood, which makes many households slip into a spiral of indebtedness, poverty and farmer suicides, large numbers of farmers are abandoning agriculture in search of employment opportunities in cities. The project aims to work closely with the poorest farmers, women, children, the elderly and the disabled to address their concerns in an integrated way, hence contributing to the empowerment of the most marginalized segments of the population. Through the project, AF aims to provide support to 57,400 families in 214 villages and 8 mandals project to enhance food and nutritional security, access to health and education, diversification of income sources, gender and social equity, and eco-friendly farming practices.","4","2012-04-01","2013-03-31","2012-04-01","2014-08-01",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs","NL-1","Government",10,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ACCION FRATERNA",NA,NA,NA,"IN","India",NA,NA,NA,NA,"311;150",";","75;25","OECD Development Assistance Committee 3 digit codes;OECD Development Assistance Committee 3 digit codes","DAC-3;DAC-3",3,"110",10,"B01","5","EUR","EUR",0,"50000","0","50000",0,0,0

Initially, it provided gender training to NGO staff across Andhra Pradesh to mainstream gender issues.  Since 1997 it has been involved in field interventions in Nalgonda district. Currently the organization is working to promote child rights with a focus on the girl child, as well as survival and education and empowerment of women. Since 1997 Gramya has been working in Nalgonda district and four additional districts to reach out to  women, girls and families from the Lambada community, to ensure education for girls and prevent violence against women. Gramya intervened in Chandampet Mandal to stop female infanticide and sale of girl babies.   The bridge school was set up as a response to provide safety and education to the most vulnerable girls among the Lambada community. The bridge school has acted as a presence to motivate Lambada families to send girls to school. With Gramya campaigns ongoing on a regular basis, the Lambada community has increasingly sent girls to school. After living with Gramya for one or two years, the girls are mainstreamed annually into the government system. 

Some of the girls who have completed high school come back to Gramya for hostel facilities to complete their higher education. Currently there are 22 girls who are enrolled in college. Gramya has reached out to 4470 children, where 2492 are girls. Gramya has ensured that children have adequate competence levels of learning for the class in which they are studying (primary school). Towards this, teacher training is provided to government volunteer teachers who act as a support to the government system in the 50 villages in which Gramya is working. Additionally, in the last three years, Gramya has supported 54 women facing domestic violence. Further they have trained more than 1300 women leaders from the government. It is projected that its self-help group programme will reach about 278 villages in five districts, to assess the condition of Lambada adolescent girls. Gramya will also be working in 50 villages intensively and more than 320 villages indirectly.ICCO’s support to this project resonates with its program for India on Children at Risk.

The founding members of CARDS are social activists of Andhra Pradesh and grassroots level leaders. A strong support during the start phase came from the Lutheran, Salvation Army, Baptist and Roman Catholic communities.  The strategy of CARDS is pursuing its mission to conceive, design, plan and implement programs with Dalits to push for their equity and equality. CARDS has  already been working on this issue for the last eight years in 20 districts in the state of Andhra Pradesh and other states, including Karnataka, Maharashtra and Orissa. CARDS is also part of the National Movement to Educate and Empower Dalit Children (NEED) from the year 2006.

The core problem being addressed in this project is illiteracy. The project aims at eliminating illiteracy among children aged between 5-15 years hailing from Dalit and the tribal communities. With the support from Kerk in Actie, CARDS has been working for the past three years on the Balabata project towards these objectives. This project is being implemented in the Ranga Reddy District of Andhra Pradesh in 8 Mandals, constituting of 154 villages. It has been focusing on providing quality education to the children in rural areas aged 5-15 years old. A total of 180 Balabatas have been established in the past three years in the said district. The project aims at eliminating illiteracy among children below 5-15 years hailing from Dalit and the tribal communities. The project aims at maintaining the 180 Balabata schools established in the previous years, with its fourfold mission – “A path shown to children by the society, and also a path shown to the society by the children”: education through play way methods (songs and scripts); encouraging children to motivate their parents to start kitchen gardens at their homes; encourage children in clean and green activities; and enabling their parents to take up Income Generation Programme under Vision 2020. The programme draws inspiration from a verse in the Bible which states, “It was a child who has shown a path to Jesus Christ to feed the 5000 by offering what he has – Two fish and Five pieces of Bread.”  By introducing new way of life to Dalit Children through Balabata CARDS proposes to build up a new society – a society based on equality and fraternity.""

Currently, there are 180 Development Organizers in the 180 Balabatas that have been established in the past three years in the project area. Regular training programs (3-5 days) are conducted for the Development professionals to equip them with skills to help them deal effectively with the school children. It is projected that during the duration of the project, 530 students will join in government residential schools to continue their education for 5th & 6th class. In the past three years 10,800 new students have joined in the Balabata schools. Out of these 5875 are now continuing their education in government schools while, the remaining 4925 children have joined local private schools. Among the new children joining the Balabata schools there are 2500 children who were child labours. Moreover, in the 154 villages nearly '18,397 families will be educated by the Balabata programme.
 
Also, there were 180 Mothers’ committee formed. The community was encouraged to take up the responsibility of educating the children and dealing with the needs of the villages. Networking with the government department was encouraged. It is interesting to note that Andhra Pradesh has shown positive performance in decreasing the percentage of Out of School Children from 5.9% to 4.1% in the last few years and programmes like the Balabata initiative has significantly contributed to the positive performance. ICCO’s support in this project is part of its program for India with the Children at Risk.

It has been instrumental in facilitating over 700 NGOs and GOs in India, Nepal and Bangladesh to establish community participatory, cost effective multi-disciplinary programs that relate to priority challenges in enabling child survival and protection, directly and indirectly. This organization believes that Community Health and Development are two sides of one coin.  It has determined that multi-pronged interventions work effectively to break the inextricable link between HIV and AIDS-related stigma, discrimination and human rights violations, especially for children living and affected by HIV and AIDS. INSA India has the reputation of creating innovative pilot initiatives promoting dignity of personhood towards its vision of a ‘just society living with health and development’. 

The current project is a continuation of a previous project and the consolidation phase of the Approaches for Boosting Child Development and Empowerment (ABCDE) project. INSA India through the ABCDE initiative introduced priority for child protection programing in the urban slums of Bangalore from 2011 onwards. The prioritization of child protection, though urgently felt, is not mainstreamed into regular child care settings, in organizations working for child rights, and least of all in communities. A case in point, a baseline study in December 2010 conducted by INSA showed that none of the child care workers knew what the child helpline number is. Moreover, INSA identified 20 child care settings in Bangalore that are in vulnerable situations, together with local and state stakeholders and began the project in January 2011. The project implementation began in March 2011 after a thorough baseline and situational assessment. The nationwide program began in May 2011 after a thorough process of floating EOIs and selecting key lead organizations. Although the project is well on its way to completion as per the project contract, there is a felt need to consolidate the project for stronger outcomes and learning. More needs to be done to strengthen the gender sensitization component that is critical for sustaining child protection. By August 2012, through a series of direct interventions, 591 children in 29 child parliaments in Bangalore claimed child rights and protection through written petitions, approached local and municipal leaders to ensure that men with substance abuse do not throw used bottles into their school yards; that garbage is not dumped in their school compound; that child abuse is recognized and child protection is respected as a child right.  Through careful selection, 17 lead organizations were partnered with for strengthening resource pools for child protection in selected areas of India spanning 10 states. In addition 2988 leaders nationwide participated in half day, one day or two day child protection consultation using the EVERY-CHILD-OUR CHILD process through 58 workshops. INSA-India team participated in adaptations of the Juvenile Justice Act. Because of this, 17 organizations have undertaken a child protection capacity audit and are developing child protection policies. It is hoped that by December 2013, stronger child participation, visibility, evidence and collectivism for child protection will be strengthened locally in Bangalore and nationwide through INSA-India undertaking consolidation processes of community building, skills, research and convergence in child protection systems and programs. ICCO’s support to this project is part of its program for India on Children at Risk.

VANI has also become coordinating agency for strengthening similar national networks in other countries of south and south east Asia, and the Far East. VANI represents the sector’s concerns through advocacy and networking activities and sensitizing the government, media, and public, VANI has so far advocated and lobbied for simplification of Acts, Rules, and Regulations pertaining to voluntary sector (Society Registration Act, Foreign Contribution Regulation Act & Income Tax Act) and taken measures to further strengthen the voluntary sector. The rationale for the current project is derived from the current scenario of rapidly changing environment for operations for NGOs in India, which threatens to restrict the operating space of civil society organizations. This changing landscape is characterized by, among other developments: a shift in development support for the voluntary sector from bilateral and flexible grants to the “tenderization” of development in which NGOs are seen as “efficient and cheap sub-contractors”; rising cases of harassment of NGOs because of their alleged involvement in the naxal (communist) activities in several states, including reduced access to local communities and false charges filed against NGO staff; growing public criticism of NGOs for misuse of tax provisions and poor functioning of the voluntary sector; and the lack of awareness among many NGOs of the changing legal and policy environment for the voluntary sector. In order to establish uniform practices amongst the NGOs and to improve internal governance, the government has announced plans to establish a national accreditation body to regulate the voluntary sector. VANI seeks to coordinate an effective response from the voluntary sector through setting up a self-regulated governance mechanism, based on a process of nationwide debate and research- based advocacy works.
Project overview: The specific objective of this project is to strengthen the capacities of the target 1000 voluntary sector small and medium sized organizations to handle relationship with government and private sector and create an enabling environment for their smooth functioning. In this way, VANI seeks to address the core factors that are contributing to the current negative environment by: (i) raising awareness of the challenges faced by the civil society as a result of the new developments in the sector; (ii) building the capacity of small and medium sized organizations to update their systems of internal governance so that the whole sector can move at one pace; (iii) contributing to the emergence of an effective institutional mechanism to ensure transparent and accountable governance within the NGO sector, which will enable them to raise the issue of good governance of public institutions; and (iv) continuing to disseminate training and specific input to capacitate NGOs to form effective partnerships with the corporate sector. An important component of the intervention is the development of strong thematic networks to enhance the profile of the voluntary sector as an influential player, both nationally and globally.

Over the years, the organization has shown strong commitment in mobilizing communities and in addressing their development needs through various intervention strategies. It has grown not just as an organization in terms of capacity and knowledge but is also recognized at the national fora as one of the pioneer NGOs in India which have contributed to the cause of marginalized section of society.
Today, it continues to enable people to become agents of their own development by building institutional space and structure so that they will be empowered to make decisions for a life of security and dignity.

The program of Seva Mandir focuses, among others; on improving the economic position of the target groups (in particular through sustainable land use, improved water management and sustainable forest management).The ultimate goal is to make these beneficiaries self-reliant in the long run. Seva Mandir aims to achieve this by building and strengthening the capacities of the target users (through education, awareness and knowledge promotion), to include the target organizations, and other relevant structures in the society (through the empowerment of the poor, political participation).

In all its programs, whenever possible, Seva Mandir (with local authorities) allows the use of local funds. The organization is hoping that its programs be adopted and replicated by the government in providing services to the people. Currently, Seva Mandir is working in 6 rural blocks in Udaipur and Rajsamand districts in addition to selected slum areas within Udaipur City and one peri-urban settlement, Delwara.

In total, Seva Mandir reaches out to over 634 settlements (including slum areas), equivalent to around 75,000 families. While Seva Mandir works with all sections of the population, it is primarily concerned with empowering the most vulnerable– women, youth, children, and other disadvantaged sections of the population. 

In this particular project, Seva Mandir with the help of ICCO will: strengthen institutions; strengthen human capabilities; and improve livelihoods. This project also fits with ICCO program for India on Food Security.

The network has been supported by ICCO since 2006. Although the network was initiated to meet the growing challenges of dealing with markets and helping the poor to improve their income levels through value chain development, it has additionally taken up the task of facilitating linkages and building the capacities of partners to engage in market-led interventions. It also seeks to facilitate enhanced cooperation among its members for sustained impact.  The members of the network have decided to register VBN under the Society Registration Act 1860 in order to attract funding from varied sources. The network reached out to more than 13,000 farmers in the first phase of the “Engaging Markets” project. The second phase of the project will intensify interventions taken up in the first phase by undertaking various livelihood programs in Jharkhand. Moreover, this phase also looks into ways to make VBN a financially sustainable unit and to contribute to relevant decision making processes to foster inclusive value chain development.

Over 10,000 healthcare professionals are registered as individual members, working in the government, NGO and corporate sectors across the country. CMAI also has strong secular collaborations and work with governments and the civil society in almost every state providing services to the marginalized and the poor. CMAI started its initiatives to combat HIV/Aids in 1992 and has undertaken numerous large scale projects ranging from training of medical personnel on diagnosis and management of HIV/Aids, production of public awareness materials, establishing learning sites in four HIV/Aids prevalent states and (with support from ICCO) developing HIV/Aids policy guidance for churches. CMAI has also worked the field of adolescent health with schools in North and South India with a focus on life skills training for students and is currently in the process of developing an accreditation system for HIV Services in hospitals. 
Project overview>> The current project aims to develop a HIV/Aids prevention program for Manipur state, which has the third highest rate of seroprevalence in the country after Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. Fear of disclosure and stigma lead most adolescents to make significant efforts to conceal their risky behaviors from families in particular, and society in general. Although there are well-established HIV and Hepatitis C co-infection epidemic among injecting drug users in Manipur, awareness is very poor. There is therefore an urgent need to build awareness about safe and unsafe drug use and sexual practices, as well as the location and availability of health services. With the support of SAN and Kerk in Actie, CMAI, in collaboration with one of its members, SHALOM, intends to sensitize adolescents about sexual and reproductive health and to identify and train volunteers and health care providers in counseling and care giving on this subject. The project will facilitate linkages with services within the government like the Adolescent Clinic in the state with constant consultation with the stakeholders. This will be one of the strategies to sustain the programme. Learning from CMAI and other youth intervention programmes will also be factored in the implementation of the project. The project will ensure that there is active participation from youth at various levels including planning, designing of module, implementation and monitoring of the program. This will be done through a process of dialogue. Through this process, change agents will be identified and encouraged to speak to and influence their peers.

With three decades of experience of poverty reduction, PRADAN sees its major future role as an enabler of large-scale poverty alleviation efforts particularly in the Central Indian Tribal Region, which is the poverty heartland of India. As PRADAN’s grassroots work expands to poorer and more remote areas, new intervention prototypes need to be developed to contribute to sustainable livelihoods, while more mature interventions will need to be hived off to stand on their own feet. PRADAN realizes that after decades of functioning as a large-scale implementing organization, a paradigm shift is required if it is to effectively scale up and deepen its impact. PRADAN therefore strives to become a facilitator of coordinated action among diverse stakeholders, exchanging knowledge and know-how with various actors, improving and increasing the pool of people and organizations engaged with the poor, and orchestrating multi-stake holder engagements to improve livelihoods and well-being of the marginalized.
Project activities and outputs>> During this project period, PRADAN will proactively identify, create linkages and engage with other stakeholders in a systematic manner to accomplish these objectives. ICCO’s support will be directed towards enabling PRADAN to build the required capabilities to manage this transition. The concrete areas of support are: 
- Providing seed capital to create internal capacities and systems to effectively manage broad-based core institutional support from longstanding partners like ICCO and Tata Trust, while attracting new financing from other societal actors, including Indian corporations, foundations and individuals; 
- Providing institutional support to create “new growth” nuclei in Rajasthan and Bihar; 
- Building partnerships with the private sector for mature business interventions;  and 
- Strengthening partnership work with other NGOs.","2","2012-04-01","2014-06-30","2012-04-01","",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs","NL-1","Government",10,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Professional Assistance For Development Action",NA,NA,NA,"IN","India",NA,NA,NA,NA,"312;311;250;150",";;;","15;50;25;10","OECD Development Assistance Committee 3 digit codes;OECD Development Assistance Committee 3 digit codes;OECD Development Assistance Committee 3 digit codes;OECD Development Assistance Committee 3 digit codes","DAC-3;DAC-3;DAC-3;DAC-3",3,"110",10,"B01","5","EUR","EUR",0,"110000","0","110000",0,0,0

The project works with the economically and socially fragile region of Vidarbha, Telangana and South Odisha. The organization, that was initially focused on creating an exclusive value chain for organic cotton has not taken an integrated approach, which is a direct result of the learnings derived from the past project.

ICCO and Solidaridad jointly initiated the Chetna Organic & Fairtrade Cotton Supply Chain Intervention Program India in 2004 as a composite pilot on organic, non-pesticide management (NPM) and Fairtrade cotton supply chain development, mainly to address the agrarian crisis faced by small-holder cotton farmers in India. The Forum for Integrated Development (FFID) was chosen as the implementing partner for the Chetna project because of its experience in sustainable agriculture. In 2007, COFA was registered as an independent national level farmers’ support organization (as a society) with a multi-state representation of members from the smallholder farmers’ cooperatives from the states of Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Odisha, mainly to promote greater ownership among the smallholder farmers over the program. 

Over the years, Chetna has emerged as an expert on sustainable (organic, non-pesticide management) agriculture-based livelihood and in providing support to various other projects and agencies, and also in representing various organizations and advisory committees, both at national and international level. In this current project, FFID will support Chetna towards addressing the multi-dimensional challenges encountered by the smallholder farmers from rain-fed regions, through community led climate resilient sustainable agriculture livelihood systems. Considering the multi-dimensional problems of the small-holder farmers from the rain-fed regions, FFID has carved out strategic thrust areas for Chetna to implement the interventions comprehensively in an integrated manner. The interventions of the project will revolve on: sustainable farmer owned and managed institutions –and emerging as innovative enterprises and domain experts and /or expert resource centre; promotion of integrated farming systems (primarily in cotton); Germplasm conservation; sustainable management of natural resources; diversification of household livelihoods portfolio and entrepreneurship; value chain development; food safety/security and nutrition; and women and child welfare. These interventions are aimed at directly reaching and impacting 30,000 small-holder farming households, with 150,000 family members, primarily engaged in cotton cultivation from the rain-fed states in India, particularly Telangana region of Andhra Pradesh, South Western region of Odisha and Vidarbha region of Maharashtra.

The next three years are important for strengthening and consolidating the work of FFID and paving the way for sustaining the institutional mechanisms put in place by Chetna Organic. ICCO’s support to this project is in line with its Fair Economic program for India.

The region experiences a lot of sunshine during the day even if the temperature falls drastically during night in winter. LEDeG’s flagship renewables program has introduced a wide range of appropriate technologies based on adaptive research to ensure their suitability to local conditions and needs. These include micro-hydroelectric units, solar photo voltaic power plants, passive solar buildings, solar water heating systems, solar ovens and cookers, and hydraulic ram pumps, all geared towards providing sustainable off-grid energy solutions for the rural poor and reducing their dependence on fossil and biomass fuels.
Project activities and outputs>> This project aims to introduce passive solar housing (PSH) technology for 100 families in Leh and Kargil districts of Ladakh. The construction technique enables the harnessing of solar radiation during the winter to heat the interior of the building, through specially designed and insulated trombe walls (sun spaces) and large south-facing solarized windows for direct heat gain. Insulated roofs and floors help absorb and retain the heat and keep the rooms warm during the day and night. The project contributes to the objectives of ICCO’s Fair Climate Program Climate because the carbon emission levels of each PSH building will go down by a minimum 3.5 tons and the total emission reduction will be around 350 tons per year after the completion of the project. This is the direct result of reduction in carbon emission in the house and also the reduction in the extraction level of trees and bushes for space heating which enhances carbon sequestration.

It is especially unique given that in India, there are two other forms of farming which has dominated the society for the longest time:  mainstream agriculture and sustainable agriculture.
Mainstream agriculture is a popular farming system of choice, aggressively promoted by the government and industry. A direct and indirect state subsidy keeps it afloat not just in the form of subsidized seeds, fertilizer and crop insurance. It is also through the creation and maintenance of an infrastructure that provides transport, communication, electricity, timely supply of farm inputs, information, technical, financial and marketing support; plus the support prices that the State pays to procure. These are hard to resist since they address the dire cash needs of the farmers. On the other hand, small and poor peasants subsist by working as agricultural labourers on middle peasant lands for less than minimum wages, and by migrating during summer months. They come back with the onset of monsoons to scratch subsistence cultivation from small patches of scattered holdings, far away from the villages and hugging the hillsides, averaging less than optimal holding sizes. Although this is sustainable farming, it is beset with insufficient inputs, inadequate attention, uncertain monsoons and continuous drought; disenchantment of schooled youth in farming, or the non-participation of women in farming matters or decisions. 

The farm sector offers significant opportunities for carbon sequestration and emission reductions. Emissions from farming contribute 14% of global Greenhouse Gases. In India, farming contributes to 28% of the national GHG emissions. Low Carbon Farming practices offer farmers the opportunity to capitalize on the carbon market, as they shift to agricultural methods that are more sustainable, involve lower input costs and result in emission reduction and sequestration by sinks.

Several Fair Climate Network Members are grassroots NGOs involved in Sustainable Agriculture (SA). They have developed technologies that go by various terms like organic or natural farming, chemical free cultivation, low external input sustainable agriculture (LEISA), permaculture, etc. These have resulted in shifts in cropping patterns and cultivation practices, and demonstrated drought resistance. They have shown these techniques as workable on demonstrations that range from small pockets in scattered villages to hundreds of hectares in contiguous tracts. Scaling up these SA practices was the challenge. 

In December 2008, FCN began to explore ways and means by which small and marginal farmers could be rewarded for their low emissions. Initially, a rather banal and prosaic definition of Low Carbon Farming (LCF) as “SA + Carbon Revenue” was formulated. The 3 other Economic Drivers that root for SA are: Increased Yield; Decreased Input Costs; Improved Price for SA Produce. On further reflection, the network now understands Low Carbon Farming as synonymous to low carbon growth trajectory in all fields of farm economics, fulfilling farm and family energy needs. In this manner, LCF contributes to the traditional understanding of Sustainable Agriculture as a healthy balance between crops, trees, animals and people. Spread across the length and breadth of India, FCN can show the developing world how to approach the issue of Climate Change domestically.  The Pan India LCF Coalition has 15 grassroots NGOs and several external stakeholders. This one year project will have just 6 Participant NGOs where 6,7615 Participating Farmers have been able to grow some crops in 2012 in spite of erratic monsoons. 6 Participant NGOs will, in the 2012 crop season, bring 9,400 Discrete Plots, totalling 17,100 acres, under Low Carbon Farming in 271 villages.  This project resonates with ICCO’s program for the region on Fair Climate Change.

The plan aims to increase the average crop intensity to 243% from 85% with the investment of INR 1,500 billion. Investment for good quality seeds and technical support from KVK (Farm Research Center) and Agriculture department are the key feature of the plan. The state’s Irrigation Department also plans to launch Bihar Satabadi Private Tube Scheme of implementing 7.5 lakh tube wells during this period, with an investment of INR 80 million. These investments open up opportunities for pro-poor value chain development in the state. Saral Services is an NGO that focuses on leveraging the power of technology to enhance the livelihoods of the poor in Patna and in Nalanda Districts of Bihar. As part of the process of operationalizing of its Multi-Annual Strategic Plan (MASP 2020), ICCO seeks to broker strong relationships between civil society, corporate sector and government initiatives for base-of-the-pyramid interventions.
Project overview>> The main objective of this project is to establish livelihood eco-systems for the poorest in Bihar, especially in the vegetable/non cereal sub sector. The project will work with a diverse network of agencies (governmental, NGO and businesses) to establish vibrant clusters of production, processing and retailing, with a robust IT infrastructure to support the development of the selected value chains. 
Project activities and outputs>> 
- Undertaking a baseline study of the vegetable/non cereal landscape in Bihar to understand the present status of the crop and associated farmers, including the poorest. The study will build on the experiences of key actors in the state including PRADAN, BRLP, ASA and the Department of Agriculture;
- Convening a consultative workshop in Patna on “Livelihood Eco-Systems for the poorest and GoB Roadmap of Agriculture 2012-17” that will bring together NGOs working to improve the livelihoods of the poorest communities in Bihar, as well as government institutions and other development partners, including SDTT, SRTT, AKF and ICCO;

The two organizations are also members of the VBN, which is a network of 18 NGOs working in state of Jharkhand. Since joining VBN, RDA and TSRD have incorporated market-based livelihood promotion in their programs, reaching 2,000 smallholder producers within the first year alone. The coalition aims to further scale this initiative in the Patanda, Ghatshila and Bhulbamgarh blocks of Jharkhand, with support from VBN and PRADAN. This area is very suitable for growing vegetables, especially tomato. However, the poorest farmers lack sufficient capital to invest in their farms and cannot access larger markets where they can earn better prices. The two organizations therefore aim to help the farmers to establish strong producer organizations at village level, with an federation of producer organizations at state level to enable smallholder farmers to access the market and increase their income from tomato and vegetable farming.
Project activities and outputs>> 
- Establishing 50 village-level farmers organizations and two cooperatives, representing 2000 smallholder farmers;
- Providing training to farmers on improved agricultural production and processing techniques to diversify income sources; 
- Enhancing partnerships with government institutions, financial services, research organizations, seed and fertilizer companies and local traders;
- Exploring the feasibility of forming an apex state level federation of smallholder producers to provide all required services and marketing linkages in future. 
Expected outcomes>>
- 4000 smallholder producers organized in producer organizations;
- Smallholders increase their income, earning an average of Rs.10,000 for 0.25 acre of land.

More than two-thirds of the population of Jharkhand state lives in rural areas, with limited livelihood opportunities, despite an abundance of rainfall, good soil and natural resources. The undulating landscape and agro-climatic condition are extremely favorable for potato production, with the added advantage of being able to produce early season potato unlike neighboring states. The fundamental problem faced by the small-scale potato producers is the shortage of quality potato tubers due to a lack of skills to propagate seed potato. They are forced to import tubers from other states, which amounts to around 60% of the total cost of inputs. Providing farmers with the requisite skills for producing quality tubers would therefore have a major impact on farmers’ marginal costs and hence increasing their income. Indian Grameen Services (IGS) works to promote and support microfinance and livelihood initiatives by community based organizations, community based microfinance institutions and upcoming NGO-MFIs in India. 
Project overview>> Under ICCO’s strategic framework (MASP 2020) the Fair Economic Development program focuses on promoting multi-stakeholder partnerships around selected value chains, piloting new models of cooperation and linking with financial and advisory resources for the capacity development and financial sustainability of producer organizations and community based enterprises. In response to high demand from farmers, IGS/BASIX has started supporting potato seed production, together with Vikas Bazar Network (VBN) partners (PRADAN, IGS, Agragati, and Arouse), Pepsico and others. This project seeks to contribute to the VBN-led initiative by supporting livelihoods of more than 2,300 enterprising smallholder and marginal farmers of Jharkhand to develop the production and marketing support system for potato seed by 2015. The project will train 40 Village Resource Persons (VRPs) to support the seed productions systems at village level and create the institutional mechanism for proper seed storage and distribution. The 2300 farmers are expected to earn an additional income of at least Rs.20000 to Rs.25000 per year/acre as a result.

The states of Andhra Pardesh, Tamil Nadu and Odisha respectively contribute 61%, 16% and 7% of the country's production. However, productivity of turmeric in Odisha, at around 2.5 Ton/ha is upto three times lower than the other states as farmers still use traditional methods and organic practices. While this can be seen as an advantage, the findings of a value chain analysis conducted by South Odisha Development Initaitive (SODI) revealed that the turmeric subsector faces many constraints, including the scarcity of traditional mulching material, an exploitative trading system and decline  of prices, all of which reduce the viability of turmeric cultivation as a livelihood option for the many farmers. 
Project overview>> This pilot project aims to enhance the productivity of 2,100 resource poor farmers in three disadvantaged districts the state by developing a model of joint cooperation for pro-poor value chain development. The project is implemented by a consortium of partners active in Odissa - Pradan, Harsha Trust, RCDC, Pragati and OPDSC Chetna Organic - and managed by the Madhyam Foundation, who is also the project holder for SODI. The pilot aims focus on working with a small group of poor producers to increase their productivity, while making small, but important linkages at the higher end of the value chain to facilitate market access for the farmers. ICCO will not only support the project financially, but will try to secure more funds for scaling up the project after the conclusion of the pilot phase. ICCO will also explore strategic collaborations with other actors such as IDH and the Rainforest Alliance. Specific interventions to be carried out by the project include:
- Improving seed selection and production techniques for higher yield;
- Introduction of processing techniques such as boiling and drying to reduce post harvest losses;
- Strengthening institutional mechanisms for better bargaining with market;

This project aims to contribute to sustained improvements of the socio-economic conditions of poor producers in the Korea district of Chhattisgarh and Anuppur district of Madhya Pradesh by adopting a value chain approach in three products, mahua (Indian butter tree), pomegranate and chilli. The project not only focuses on increasing the incomes of tribal poor families, but also to develop appropriate institutional mechanism for the producers. The project has mobilized support from the National Bank for Rural Development (NABARD), the Indian government’s rural banking arm for establishing horticultural farms and from Axis Bank Foundation (one of India’s premier private bank) for human resources and training, ICCO’s support is mainly focused on activities to strengthen upper end of the value chain in processing, institution building and marketing of the produce.
Project activities and outputs>> The two-year project aims to reach a total of 1900 producers (600 chilli producers, 100 pomegranate producers and 1200 mahua collectors). The value additions in these crops/ produce are simple and will be executed with support from research agencies. Fruiting has already started for the pomegranate trees promoted and the focus will be on increasing the productivity and quality and also marketing the produce. An appropriate package of production and processing techniques will be developed to enhance the productivity and quality of chilli, and ensure that producers benefit from successive levels in the value chain. For mahua, appropriate technology and credit linkages for storage have been identified as essential steps for increasing the sale price. With a major focus on marketing and developing linkages with the private sector, the project will support a team exclusively devoted to marketing the produce not only from these farmers but from other regions where Srijan works.","2","2012-12-01","2014-11-30","2012-12-01","",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs","NL-1","Government",10,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Self Reliant Initiatives through Joint Action",NA,NA,NA,"IN","India",NA,NA,NA,NA,"311","","100","OECD Development Assistance Committee 3 digit codes","DAC-3",3,"110",10,"B01","5","EUR","EUR",0,"69651","0","69651",0,0,0

Pairvi has been an old ICCO partner mostly supported under the Conflict Transformation and Democratization project. However Pairvi is also recognized for its strong lobby and advocacy work in the area of food security and climate change issues. This intervention aims at improving the food security scenario in some of the poorer states namely Bihar, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgrah by adopting a comprehensive approach to food and nutritional security. This includes engaging with systemic issues such as production, distribution and management, and the impact of other policies and legislation on food security. Preliminary analysis of previous interventions shows that while macro-economic indicators, and broader policy initiatives receive appropriate attention from the point of view of advocacy and lobbying, FNS efforts at state and micro levels have remained under the radar. Moreover, despite concerted efforts around FNS issues such as the national food security bill, seeds Bill, FDI Policy, biotechnology regulation and the Land Acquisition Act, not enough efforts have been made to scale up the nutritional emergency, experiences and gaps in managing malnutrition, and food security at state level. It is noteworthy for instance that many better-off states too face the challenges of ensuring improved FNS to the ever-rising number of children and women living in poverty. 
Project activities and outputs>> This intervention builds on previous FNS program experiences to arrive at a better understanding of the drivers of food security, hunger and malnutrition and hence contribute to improved policy responses at state and national level. The project further aims to raise the profile of nutrition in the national food policy framework, and provide policy-relevant insights on malnutrition management. Specific activities and outputs of the project include:
(i) Undertaking the first comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness and program performance of nutrition rehabilitation centres (NRCs) in four states, and especially the linkages and gaps in positioning nutrition within the institutional policy framework on delivering right to food. The findings will be discussed in the state consultations and national consultations with a view to informing nutritional management policies at state and national level. 
(ii) Preparing a scoping paper on malnutrition management in India and implications for policy to address the lack of an operational definition of malnutrition, standards and baseline data, tools for identification of malnutrition and entry and exit criteria for NRCs. The paper aims to generate insights for better institution and community-based management of malnutrition, and options for policy and operational support.
(iii) Developing a Hunger Reduction Commitment Index to assess the commitments of state governments and their performance on reducing hunger and malnutrition. The index will provide a valuable advocacy tool for civil society advocates to monitor the performance of state governments on a variety of factors and indicators, and offer policy options for improved status in these states (including Bihar, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, MP, Chhattisgarh and Uttarakhand).

Sahjeevan, (coined word for sah or together and jeevan or living) was set up in 1991 and has over a decade of experience  working on action research and developing models with the women collectives. It links society with technology, building relationships with communities and collaborating to integrate traditional and modern methods of natural resource management. The organization connects communities with technical resources, and monitors progress within the community until the projects are sustainable. Sahjeevan has focused in the rural areas of Kutch for approximately twenty years. In the past few years, it has begun working in urban areas as well. It is also an active member of the Kutch Nav Nirman Abhiyan a civil society network, leading the Drought Proofing Program in the district, coordinated by the same people. 

Sahjeevan has four main units: Water, Renewable Energy, Animal Husbandry, and Urban. The first three units focus on the rural poor in their respective areas of expertise, and the urban unit works in the city of Bhuj and its slums on drinking water and solid waste management projects. One of the reasons that Sahjeevan developed an urban team is because of the toll the 2001 Bhuj earthquake. Camel is one of the important livestocks in the Kachchh region. Due to accelerated industrializations in Kutch, particularly after the 2001 earthquake, the camel breeders of Kutch had problems finding enough grazing areas for the camel as a lot of these have been destroyed due to the construction of SEZs and other industrial activities. 

Due to this, the project aims to create food and livelihood security of camel breeders by strengthening the breeders’ association. The goal is for the breeders to establish a market for camel milk and other camel products, while ensuring the conservation and protection of natural resources which they have been traditionally using for camel grazing. The program will especially focus on the empowerment of women through the formation of women groups at village and taluk level. They will also be given orientation on other income opportunities from camel milk and other camel products. Further towards ensuring animal health care, various health camps will be organized to ensure increased animal health care while reducing mortality. Also, to ensure the sustainability of the program lobbying and advocacy will be continuously held. ICCO’s support for this project will help create food and livelihood security among the camel breeders in the region, which also resonates with its Food and Nutrition Security program for India.

In these villages however, because of the lack of toilet facilities, people are forced to defecate in the open, resulting to diseases, high mortality, morbidity and health hazards. Women suffer the most in this situation. Sometimes they face sexual harassment due to lack of privacy. The lack of sanitation facility in schools leads school girls to drop out of school.  

Because of this, the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation is administering the flagship program known as Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan (NBA) in all the states in India. Through this, the Ministry is providing financial support for the construction of individual household toilets for the people living Below Poverty Line (BPL), marginal farmers, castes and tribes. In spite of this, there was hardly any change or improvement in the situation of villagers due to some reasons. Under the program of the Ministry of New and Renewable energy, financial support is provided for family biogas plant based on animal dung. Additional incentive amounting to 30-35% of the total cost of a biogas plant is given to family-linked biogas. However, most people are unable to bear the cost of construction of biogas plant especially the below poverty line families. Cognizant of this situation, Program FINISH will initiate the pre triggering and triggering phase of safe sanitation and generation of bio energy. Program FINISH stands for Financial Inclusion Improves Sanitation and Health and is being supported and implemented since 2009 by an Indian-Dutch consortium comprising of banks, insurance companies, NGOs and academic and government institutions from the two countries. Its objective is to provide safe sanitation systems (i.e. toilets with proper treatment of waste produced) to low income communities in rural India through mobilizing funds from end-user households. The goal is to provide family size biogas plant based on cow/ buffalo dung as well as human excreta. The program will be implemented in Valsad, Navsari, and Surat districts of Gujarat. It is estimated that 4000 individual household in the phased manner (2000 new LTGB units+ 2000 Toilets) will be linked to existing bio gas unit.

Biogas plant is important in providing sustainable energy sources in rural communities. Generation and utilization of bio-energy from human wastes has additional advantages. It helps improve sanitation, provide bio-energy at negligible recurring expenditure and finally slurry/ effluent of biogas plant has more plant nutrient value to be used for agriculture purposes. The project aims to provide proper training to the beneficiaries for operation and maintenance of the plant. It also aims to   address the social stigma attached to the use of gas obtained from human excreta for cooking purpose and the use of dried slurry of human excreta as fertilizer.

The above project involves different stages of implementation; pre-triggering, triggering, post triggering and scaling up.  ICCO's support for post triggering and scaling up of the project will be valuable. Not only will the need for basic, hygienic toilets become a dream come true for the beneficiaries, but at the same time, the generation of sustainable bio energy will benefit the stakeholders and the environment as well.

Both RDA and TSRD are members of the Vikas Bazar Network (VBN), which is a network of 18 NGOs working in the state of Jharkhand. Both organizations mainly work with very poor household belonging to tribal and disadvantaged families in the area; most of whom are very small farmers (land holding: 0.5 Ha average).

While RDA and TSRD are both established organisations in terms of social and rights based work, they have only started working on market based livelihood promotion after becoming members of VBN. In the first year, the coalition has reached out to 2000 producers. In the second year, it rose to 3,000 producers; and in this project duration, the coalition will reach out to about 4000 small producers.

This project is being implemented jointly by RDA and TSRD, with the support of VBN and PRADAN, in the Patamda, Ghatshila and Bhulbamgarh blocks in Jharkhand. These areas are very good for growing vegetables and are especially known for their tomatoes. However, the small farmers find it difficult to access the bigger markets and better prices. They also find it difficult to get quality inputs like seeds and fertilizers in time. Since most of the farmers are poor, they also lack money to invest in agriculture. The farming practices of these small farmers are not scientific and they produce much less compared to the more financially-able farmers. Hence, this project aims to establish a replicable model of tomato value chain and producer’s institution which will ensure fair access to the market to facilitate sustainable income of small and marginal producer within ten years’ time. Through this project, it is hoped that a sustainable annual income of at least Rs.10,000 for 4000 individual producers from 0.25 acre land, leading to total additional earning of Rs.300,00,000 is achieved. Also, this project will help establish direct linkage of farmers with major markets and market players, as well as increase the farmers’ access to information and communication regarding markets, market rate, demand –supply, modern technology. This project also aims to promote producers’ cooperative to provide opportunity for the small holders to access markets, information, linkage, resources, and technology, among others.

It’s membership comprise of 17 Regional Councils of Churches (RCCs), 17 All India Christian Organizations (AICOs), and 7 Related Agencies (RAs). The NCCI manages its intervention through 7 commissions and 3 Autonomous Bodies of the Council. The Council has its headquarters in Nagpur and runs a liaison office in Delhi. The main thrusts of the Council are Mission, Evangelism, Unity, Policy, Governance and Public witness, Justice, Peace and Creation. NCCI carries forward these thrusts within and through the member churches, Regional Councils of Churches and AICOs and especially among women, young people, Dalits, tribes, and through the children. Among its many activities, the NCCI has been in the forefront of making policies in the field of HIV/AIDS (this in partnership with the ICCO & KiA, Netherlands), climate justice, youth and children; committing itself to justice in all its pursuits. The NCCI has initiated campaigns for justice for Dalit Christians. The Christian Service Agency or CSA (the contracted agency by ICCO) is the service wing of the NCCI. Almost all the programs are undertaken by the CSA on behalf of the NCCI. The CSA undertakes programs in line with capacity building in the areas of ecology and the Church, peace-building, youth and ecumenical formation, gender, mainstreaming and advocacy, and on issues relating to the public witness of the church.
ICCO has partnered with NCCI/CSA since 2007 to operationalize Ecumenical solidarity for HIV and AIDS (ESHA) amongst Protestant churches in India .The HIV and AIDS Policy Guideline which was accepted by the Member Churches of NCCI in Shillong General Assembly in 2008 was the first milestone. As the next operational step, ESHA identified the salient features of this historic document, namely-gender, sex & sexuality stigma and discrimination, and mainstreamed them over the last 4 years through various initiatives.  ESHA has played a prominent role in encouraging and accompanying NCCI to become increasingly visible in its overall response to stigma and discrimination. From the initial denial and silence, a remarkable progress is being witnessed. ESHA has contributed to an “awakening in churches and church institutions” by, among other strategies, providing quality theological literature, mobilizing men and boys, and using Contextual Bible Study (CBS). Meanwhile in 2013, two National-level Policies – one on Education [NEPE], and the other, a Work Place Policy (WPP) for NCCI’s Christian Organisations were developed and rolled out in some constituencies. In the current phase (phase 4), the program implemented will be scaled up to other AICOs and Christian education institutions. Phase 4 will also be the consolidating phase of the collaborative work of ICCO and ESHA over the last several years.  
The phase 4 of this project will focus on consolidating the collaborative work of ICCO and ESHA over the last several years.  The two important focuses will be to demonstrate the implementation of a Work Place Policy for selected 5 India Christian Organisations (AICOS) of NCCI. Second, is to formulate guidelines for Educational Institutions to enable them to incorporate the Inclusive features of NEPE. Another key feature is to demonstrate implementation in 35 colleges by All India Association for Christian Higher Education (AIACCHE), which will facilitate scale up. The program also emphasises the creation of an Interfaith Youth Action Team from all over India. This will include youth who attended the Regional and National Conferences [in Phase 3 year 2 and 3], and marginalized voices like transgenders and PLWA. The primary stakeholders in the program will be the 13 All India Christian Organizations, the Schools managed by the 30 member churches of the NCCI represented by their respective education boards and the local congregations of the mainline Protestant and Orthodox Churches in India and leaders from different faith (like Islam, Hindu and Sikh). ICCO’s support to this project is in line with its Health and HIV/AIDS program for India.

The district experiences chronic drought owing to which there is extensive crop loss every seven out of ten years. Malnutrition, illiteracy, illnesses, deprivation, and caste and gender discrimination in Anantapur are higher than the state average. This project builds on the project “Promotion of Sustainable Agriculture & Diversified Livelihoods” pioneered by AF, but focuses on scaling up actions at farmer level by enhancing the capacity of government institutions to implement watershed development programs. The project aims to reach about 62, 000 families in 230 villages in 8 mandals of Anatapur district to enhance food and nutritional security, income security, enhanced livelihoods, gender and social equity, eco-friendly farming practices and public awareness and advocacy for appropriate and sustainable agricultural policies. The project aims to contribute to the following specific objectives: i) Strengthening 856 producer groups and their federations to work in a coordinated way in order to achieve their development goal; reduce the cost of cultivation and mitigate drought through diversified cropping and other sustainable agricultural practices on 11,200 ha of land belonging to 5,600 farmer families (35% of the 16,000 target farmer families); (ii) Supporting 15,000 farmers to adopt low carbon farming on 12,000 ha of land in order to qualify for carbon revenues; (iii) Diversifying the livelihoods of 3,237 youth from the target families through alternate off-farm/non-farm activities; (iv) Raising public awareness and lobbying the government to create favorable policies to enable the scaling up of low external input sustainable agriculture (LEISA). Overall, the project aims to make a strong contribution to ICCO’s strategic objectives relating to food & nutritional security, health, education, livelihood security and sustainability, while also advancing justice, and dignity for all by empowering the most marginalized through integrated social and economic programs.

VANI is also involved in strengthening similar national networks in other countries of South and South East Asia, and the Far East. VANI represents the sector’s concerns through advocacy and networking activities and raising public awareness through the media. It has lobbied the government to create a more conducive environment for the voluntary sector through reform and amendments of, among others, the Society Registration Act, Foreign Contribution Regulation Act and Income Tax Act. Under this new program focusing on governance issues for the voluntary sector, VANI will undertake research and documentation activities as well as various consultations in line with ICCO’s MASP 2020 strategic framework, which emphasizes the need to strengthen civil society movements to advance justice and dignity for all. Using a multi-stakeholder approach, the project will work with community based organizations working the most marginalized sections of society, particularly the Dalit and other minority groups, with a focus on strengthening women’s leadership in such organizations.. Hence efforts would be made of strengthening such kind of organizations. The project will target 384 VANI members, including all women-headed organizations (around 15% of VANI’s membership) and almost 2000 non-member organizations in 10 target states. It will also involve a range of government institutions whose policies have a direct impact on the livelihoods and rights of marginalized groups, including Planning Commissions, ministries of rural development, human resources, housing and urban development, health, home affairs and finance. 
Project activities and outputs>> The project will undertake both primary and secondary level data collection and convene various workshops and consultations to discuss the draft findings. In addition, VANI will convene two meetings at the regional and national level focusing on minorities issues, enabling environment, good governance policies and overall strengthening of the sector. 
Expected outcomes>> 
- 50 % of the target NGOs enhance their capacity to mobilize domestic resources, including private giving;
- 25% of the targets NGOs at grassroots level have a clear understanding of new regulatory reforms like FCRA and DTC;
- 25% of the target NGOs are following good governance practices, including basic organizational policies such as human resources and financial management and gender equity;
- There is an increase in joint programs between the government, private sector and NGOs;
- 10 % of the targets NGOs are reporting regularly to the government.

Being positioned at the lowest social order of Indian society, Dalit women face a triple marginalization based on class, caste, and gender. The Dalit Foundation was registered in June 2003 as a public trust committed exclusively to the eradication of caste discrimination and the empowerment of Dalits and other marginalized communities. This ICCO-supported multi-stakeholder project to be implemented in two states of Odisha and Uttar Pradesh seeks to build Dalit women’s capacities to fight against the violence and oppression they face by targeting potential women leaders who can help accelerate processes of change in the lives of Dalit women. 
Project activities and outputs: One of the change theories underlying the project design is that when women have access to knowledge combined with access to resources, they are more capable to lead change in their families and communities. Apart from leadership and capacity building the thrust of the program will therefore be on contributing to the economic empowerment of Dalit women, with a focus on creating a sustainable development model. To ensure the sustainability of the program its interventions and activities will be implemented at the community level thus not only making women more aware about the impact of violence and oppression, but also sensitizing the broader community as well.

EDF is one of the core members of the Fair Climate Network (FCN). Low-carbon development is an integral component of EDF’s work on international climate, which includes demonstrating benefits for participants in terms of reducing their agriculture-input costs (e.g., for fertilizer) and improved long term yields, as well as how carbon markets can provide an additional income stream to farmers, thus helping incentivize adoption of new strategies. Though focused on India, this initiative has far broader ramifications. Because smallholder communities have important similarities even across global regions, creating workable systems in India will provide inspiring models that can be adapted for use elsewhere. This follow up project builds on pilot EDF projects supported by ICCO and its partners in four locations in India. Hitherto, the FCN partners have established five labs (each proximate to a field site) at the following locations: Accion Fraterna Ecology Centre in Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh; Bharath Environment Seva Team in Pudokottai, Tamil Nadu; Palmyrah Workers’ Development Society in Marthandam, Tamil Nadu; Social Animation Centre for Rural Education and Development in Bangalore Rural District, Karnataka; and Timbaktu Collective in Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh (beginning operations in September 2013). A sixth lab is due to established in late 2013/early 2014. Three labs will become operational in additional agro-ecological zones later in 2014. The overall goal of the project is to promote long term sustainable farming by operationalizing the use of carbon markets. The markets reward farmers who adopt low-carbon farming practices, thus increasing farmers’ incomes and reducing their expenses while also minimizing agricultural emissions of greenhouse gases. 
Project activities and outputs>> The project aims to:
(i) Generate the data needed to develop GHG emission reductions methodologies for smallholder farming for rice and upland crops, and securing approval of those methodologies from an international standard-setting body;
(ii) Generate the data needed to establish regional emission factors for three or more crops in a total of eight agro-ecological zones, thus allowing the methodologies to be applied with regard to those crops in those zones:
(iii) Build capacity among local NGOs to establish and run analytic laboratories, thus enabling them to generate the data needed to establish emission factors for additional regions and crops and, in turn, allowing additional farmers to be rewarded by carbon markets for using LCF practices.
Expected outcomes>> LCF-EMD will strengthen the capacity of the FCN and its member Indian NGOs to generate emission factors for additional crops and additional agro-ecological zones inasmuch as the laboratory equipment and tools, staff training, standard operating procedures and manuals will remain available after this project is completed. Under the  MASP 2020 strategic framwork, EDF and FCN form an important part of ICCO’s long term strategic alliances and this project will contribute to strengthening this partnership.

SODI came into being in 2010 and is guided by two strategic needs: contributing to the well-being of the poor by sharing resources and expertise to enrich and expand replicable models of development in South Odisha region; and drawing strong and powerful messages from micro-level actions to influence macro-level policy reforms. Initial support from ICCO and Kerk in Actie has been instrumental in enabling SODI to demonstrate a collaborative model of working on common issues. Against this backdrop, SODI members would like to promote food and nutritional security among small and marginal farmer households, who suffer from chronic food insecurity leading to starvation, malnutrition, child and maternal deaths and migration. Moreover poor households are not able to access various entitlements put in place to alleviate this situation due to a lack of awareness and collective bargaining power. 
Project activities and outputs>> This project aims to develop a pilot mechanism to enhance access to adequate and nutritious food throughout the year for 4,000 smallholder households in 100 villages of Koraput, Malkangiri and Rayagada districts. The project will supplement an existing initiative to improve the production of pigeon pea farmers in the same area. Specific attention will given to women, infants and school going children, the elderly, and landless families. The project has two specific objectives. At the community level, it aims to enhance the productivity of assets and labor by upgrading crop production and livestock rearing practices and linking farmers to markets. At the network level, the project aims to bridge the micro-macro gap by linking community structures with government agencies and other stakeholders. The project will promote a number of activities to realize the two objectives:
(i) Expanding the cultivation and productivity of vegetables, horticultural crops, field crops and improved access to animal and human health care; 
(iI) Supporting household and community-level training and exposure to facilitate adoption of improved practices;
(iii) Facilitating the sharing of resources and expertise among partner NGOs to enrich and expand the pilot model for achieving food and nutritional security.

The main components of the project are 6 farmer -producer companies, covering almost   113 villages, spread over 8 blocks of Kutch District, with 4 partner organizations. The main objective of the project is to support producers for sustainability of agriculture and livestock production system to enhance food and livelihood security. This project also aims to strengthen the capacity of producer companies to enhance quality of services to increase the reach to 113 villages under the producer company, by developing business related to agriculture.

During the project, it is hoped that 2475 farmer families will be involved directly or indirectly into this project to enhance their income through supporting the producers for sustainability of agriculture and livestock production system (through producer companies). Also, it is envisioned that 6 producer companies will be established in Kutch district of Gujarat; with each of them buying from farmers and selling to the market up to 1000 tons of output during one season. Through the interventions of this project, 300 farmer & livestock owner families get direct benefit, and approximately about 250 families from the area will get indirect benefits through value addition of the agriculture and milk produce at the producer company level, with promotion of local traditional variety of seeds. Fodder management and storage system development activity will be carried out as well with six producer companies, covering about 150 farmer and livestock owner-families. 

Producers and producer companies will likewise be empowered and strengthened in this project. Training, capacity building of producers will be carried out to about 250 farmer & livestock owner families. Workshop at district and state levels will be organised for capacity building of producer companies and for better linkages with different schemes of governments and private sectors. This project fits in ICCO’s Food and Nutrition Security program for the region, benefitting 6 producer organisations, and 2475 families for sustainability of agriculture and livestock production system.

In India, CSR is deemed to provide a major role in the field of development. Since the new Companies Bill has been passed in Parliament, the project partners will provide support to ICCO and its CSO partners in developing a portfolio of engaging the CSRs of prominent companies in India in the development process.

It is assumed that after the passing of the Companies Bill in 2013, 2% of the profits of certain companies in India have to be reserved for community development projects through CSR. However, concrete action relative to this has yet to be taken by most corporations. In India, approximately 200 Billion INR is dedicated for CRS annually. Not only is the budget substantial, but there is no clear cut plan by most corporates on the use of these resources.

This project aims at targeting corporates with a substantial outlay of CSR funds, while helping them to utilise the funds in the most efficient manner at the same time. One of the objectives of the project is to organize deliberations and workshops between CSO partners and the private sector that have been involved in CSR activities. Specific action points for this project include the identification of companies that lack a specific CSR plan, helping them strengthen their CSR portfolio and support targeted interventions in a phased manner. The project seeks to mobilize resources from the corporate world for ICCO partners. ICCO's support will be aimed at supporting CSRs to develop a pro poor and pro community portfolio.

This project is in line with ICCO’s overall goal, wherein the partner base is diversified, to include targeted interventions with the private sector. Through this project, the following interventions will be carried out:  consultancy to develop the CSR portfolio, specifically engaging at least two companies on CSR development; organise Consultative Workshop with the corporate sector on possible partnership development; and detailed monitoring and follow up of existing CSR projects.

The adoption of the Slum Act in 2002 paved the way for people living in slums to galvanize themselves and achieved positive results for change. Janasahayog was subsequently transformed into an independent community based organization in August 2003 that is managed and led by people living in slums. In recent years the Centre has been successful in mobilizing communities in eight cities in the state of Karnataka, including the state capital, Bangalore, to secure access to justice and fundamental rights such as jobs, medical treatment, housing and sanitation. At the same time, the project has created strong leadership within the community members, enabling them to speak for themselves in the process of demand rights and helping to revive their sense of identity and culture. 
Project overview: This project will continue to focus on securing the rights of the residents of urban slums in 8 cities of Karnataka, with the overall goal of reducing social discrimination and deprivation, and to uphold multi-cultural social justice and equity through community-led action. The specific objectives of the project are to: enable a conducive atmosphere for enhancing awareness and consciousness of deprived communities; strengthen peoples’ institutions in deprived communities; and enable conducive atmosphere for integrating and promoting the cultures of deprived communities. The project will prioritize
the capacity development of youth and women to take on leadership roles in their community.

As the market gains prominence, the need for women to become knowledgeable, confident and to lead enterprises just as they have led microcredit initiatives becomes critical. Udyogini has made innovative efforts to establish theory and practice for women's microenterprise knowledge, promotion and service provision for outreach. It works with the poor, mainly illiterate women to improve their skills as producers and their knowledge of the markets they operate in, so as to ensure long-term returns. This program operates  in Rajasthan, MP, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, UP, Bihar, and Orissa,  but a variety of enterprise services are provided  in many other states as well.

In the past 10 years, Udyogini has been the pioneer in micro-enterprise and value chain development to empower women in rural India. Vegetable has become a crucial part of value chain product as it provides a substantial income to women throughout the year. Densely forested and insurgency-affected Bundu is one of the largest and tribal-inhabited blocks of Ranchi district in Jharkhand. The societal pattern of the block is traditionally patriarchal. Girls are denied access to education and are married off early. The families have only 4 months of assured livelihoods and for the rest of the year they mainly depend on wages from agricultural labour. 

This project will promote vegetables to enhance income, enterprise and skills of 500 rural women in Humta and Gambhariya panchayat of Bundu block (Ranchi district) within one year and build the value chain, coupled with an institutional focus within three years. Humta and Gambhariya Panchayat of Bundu block are among the poorest areas of Jharkhand, with a population of 4600 people, with 950 households. Vegetable cultivation is being practiced by more than 75% of the households. Tomato is one of the major vegetable being cultivated in this area and it has the involvement of maximum workforce of the Panchayat, with a peak season yield of around 200 quintals per month. In the villages like Jaamgami, kajibaru, Lotehatu, Kuchidih of this Panchayat, more than 70% of the households grow tomato in their field. However, repeated cultivation has affected the yield rate of this highly favoured crop. And since tomato is highly perishable, farmers are faced with poor sales at the market. The lack of organized aggregation and marketing system at the producer’s level results in farmers not getting fair prices for their produce. In this project, Udyogini will work on its key value chain innovations that lie in the architecture of the chain and its approach to service delivery, focusing on capacity-building, systems and key value chain tiers for controlling the production, value-addition and marketing processes.  The strategies  in this project  involve research and development; building capacity of producers; building up of business development service providers (BDSPs); promotion of vegetable enterprises through BDSPs; systems and institutions; and creation and strengthening of  agriculture.

Through this intervention, ICCO will help ensure the food security of 500 families will increase (previously from 6-9 months) to a year. At least 540 women will have an improved socio-economic condition which will also influence their and their family's nutritional and health status positively. At least 400 children will have an improved nutritional and health condition through enhanced health and nutritional practices within the community, as well as access to government development schemes. This project also supports ICCO’s Food and Nutrition Security Program for the region.

CIIE has a history of working closely with entrepreneurs and start-ups and has mentored several successful entrepreneurs. With this project, ICCO India seeks to provide an integrated and sustainable approach solution to the capacity building of POs. This is in line with the vision set forth in the strategic framework (MASP 2020) for the Fair Economic Development program, wherein ICCO acts as a broker and facilitator of multi-stakeholder approaches to address common development challenges. The project is designed as a long-term initiative in which the successful completion of each cycle of PO assessment and capacity building will leverage funding from new partners to support more POs. 
Project activities and outputs>> CIIE will organize visioning workshops, develop the business plan and provide backstopping support to the five POs over the period of one year, following which Scopeinsight will conduct a follow up rating/assessment of the POs. The success of the project will be measured by the positive change in the SI ratings. The capacity development activities will be provided provided by CIIE staff as well as IIMA faculty, alumni and students. Mentors and service providers from the private sector who span a variety of functional areas, sectoral domains and geographical locations will also be brought on board.

In 2007 the organization initiated the Golden Weavers’ Project, an Ericulture livelihood project, with support from Sir Dorabji TataTrust. In order to ensure optimum benefits to the community, Grameen Sahara subsequently incorporated an Eri Silk Producer Company in 2011, which is owned and run by the producers themselves. The organization also promotes and implements System of Crop Intensification (SCI) and Diversion Based Irrigation (DBI) in various areas of Assam. Through its microfinance operations, Grameen Sahara currently reaches around 27,000 families in the area. 
Project overview: This project is implemented as part of a new Grameen Sahara program that aims to promote sustainable livelihoods for the poor through the provision of financial services, technical assistance and other development support services in integrated manner. The specific objectives are to: improve the pace and quality of life of the rural and urban poor especially the village and decentralized sector; focus attention on women, children, the historically disadvantaged scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, minorities and other marginalized communities for their economic self-sustenance; create, develop and support self employment avenues for rural and urban youth; build social capital that will be used by and for the community; and optimally utilize all the available natural, social, economic and other resources for the well being of the community. 
Project activities and outputs: The project aims to facilitate the organization of producer groups of women weavers and spinners to address common problems such marketing, publicity, product diversification, skills upgrading. It will also provide capacity development support in the field of design development as well as working capital assistance towards purchase of raw materials. To address the scarcity of cocoons during the lean seasons, Grameen Sahara will also maintain a stock of cocoons to meet the needs of spinners. As a result of these activities, the project aims to contribute to higher and more predictable income for home-based women producers due to increased production and product quality This is expected to enhance the self respect and status of women in the community. By providing a steady supply of cocoons, the project will also help safeguard producers against market price fluctuations.

According to the Economic Survey in 2007-08, 93% of India’s workforce is either self-employed or employed from unorganized sectors. The workers of the informal sector do not have regular jobs as their work is seasonal or they depend on contract or are contractual workers. Many of them are obliged to migrate to other parts where there is some work; these workers do not have an employer. Their wages are very low, subsistence wages in most cases. These workers are unprotected in the sense that in most cases they do not have social protection, social security and are not entitled to old age pension. Given also the fact that the trade unions are not really present in the informal sector, it is difficult for them to raise problems in the tripartite negotiations. Informal sector workers, must therefore organize themselves, form unions and with the help of existing unions and civil society organization, realize that all Core Labour Rights, should be respected in the work places and in the society. 

Creating awareness within the unorganized sector on labour rights is the key entry point for initiatives for the Centre for Labour Education and Development (CLEAD). The work this organization has undertaken towards supporting transformation of informal sector economy by making it decent and less exploitative for workers undoubtedly needs support. With the assistance of Kerk in Actie and ICCO, CLEAD has been actively involved in conducting surveys on unorganized sector workers, Awareness Camps on Labour Rights, Social Security and Welfare Boards and Skill Training programs and Self-Help Group Training for women. These have helped unorganized workers from various occupations to get organized into unions and to access their rights and become registered in Welfare Boards, so that they can derive benefits from them.

The main problem that will be addressed by the proposed project is to make the problems of labour conditions, migration, bondage, child labour and marginalization become visible through survey and awareness.  This will not only help the workers realize their rights with respect to Welfare Boards but also lead to the improvement of their working and living conditions. The social equity in terms of caste and gender are also implicit in the invisibility and vulnerability of manual workers. Specifically the issues of women workers will be focused on, and strategies will tackle on how to overcome the economic and sexual exploitation and inequity. Elimination of bondage and child labour and protection of migrant labour are also a priority in this project, especially in the Districts of Chennai, Madurai, Trichy, Thiruvallur, Kanchipuram, Villupuram, Cuddalore; as well as the Districts of Tuticorin and Krishnagiri. 

The primary stakeholders (beneficiaries) are workers in various occupations: agriculture; handloom; street vending; domestic; sanitary; fish; and salt pan, among others. This project is in line with ICCO’s program for Children at Risk in India.

Mother and child health is one of the thematic focuses of the project. Madhepura district is located in Bihar State, one of the least developed states of India. 

The project is being implemented in 10 villages of Gowalpara block of Madhepura district. 
With a population of 103 million of which 87% reside in rural areas communities are  at times isolated from information, services, and supplies, which support survival. Over 54% of the population is below the poverty line. The infant mortality rate is 48 deaths per 1000 live births (2012). For Madhephure it is the highest in the state (64 deaths per 1000 live births).  Under 5 years of age mortality rates is 70 per 1000 children is the fifth highest in the country.  The maternal mortality ratio of Bihar  is 274 deaths per 100,000 live births (2014) the second highest in the country. 
Madhepura Child Development project aims to reach the unreached in the neglected and deserted parts of the state. The target communities are economically poor Dalit and vulnerable groups of tribal communities called Santhals and Yadav.  

The project works towards an increased access and utilisation of government health schemes and services by the target communities and improved quality services offered by the government PHC and Sub – centres. 
The project works with change agents that are supported by community based organizations  in addressing factors that impede access to mother and child health care. Community organization and mobilization takes place and the  strengthening of community based organizations and change agents to facilitate the use and access of health services. Cluster and block level mass awareness campaign on mother & child health care, immunization, National Rural Health Mission and HIV/AIDs is one of the activities of the change agents. At village level community meetings on mother & child health care, immunization, National Rural Health Mission and HIV/AIDS take place.  Cluster and block level meeting with Primary Health Centre and Integrated Child Development Scheme and other government health & nutrition schemes and programme contribute to better access.  Communities are facilitated to submit petitions to government health and concerned departments on community health issues.  Training and capacity building of Village Health Committee on community monitoring systems of the government health programmes at village level contributes to towards the accountability of the health services.

The project collaborates with government departments – Health, Education and administration to access resources and services for the targeted communities. Other NGOs specialized in health sector – I.e Madhepura Christian Hospital, Emmanual Health Association and Nav Jyothi Mission. Resource organization like PRAXIS- for advocacy and action research support.

EHA empowers communities to demonstrate good stewardship of their available natural resources.  

In the target area many villages faces severe drought each year. Major part of the landscape is undulating and rocky with thin layer of soil cover, steep slopes with high surface runoff, unavailability of drought resistant variety of quality seeds coupled with unavailability of livelihood opportunities. The Human Development Indicators such as literacy, health, and poverty reflected an all time low, with the result that the area was labelled  by the government as backward and unfortunate. The target area consists mainly Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Caste population. The population largely resides in little hamlets scattered a few kilometres from each other. Many villagers live on a single meal a day.  Most are dependent on agriculture labour for their living, Scarcity of irrigation facilities (only 21% of the farmers in the target population have facility for irrigation whole year round), no land rights and no adequate agricultural knowledge leads to insufficient agricultural produce, which in turn forces many to migrate to the nearest big town or city in search of daily wage labour. Unemployment rate is high. The high prevalence of under-nutrition among the target population is due to poverty, lack of awareness about, and access to and utilization of the available nutrition supplementation programmes; social barriers preventing the utilization of available nutrition supplementation programme and services; lack of safe drinking water. 

The aims as described above are worked towards by activities on crop diversification, raise the gound water level, anticipating on Climate Change and focus on Disaster Risk Reduction, improved food production, gender equality for food, Rigth to Food campaign. The main strategy  of the project is to empower communities (capacities, ownership, knowledge, skills, attitude). Helping & orienting the people to help themselves by forming appropriate groups, consolidating themselves and implementing their own objectives to accomplish. Another strategy is to cooperate with all relevant stakeholders and activities in the villages and their area in one catchement area, to ensure the sustainability. 

EHA cooperates together with the communities, relevant government authorities and departments and NGOs. EHA is member of several networks, alliances and coalitions.

This project will build on the findings of a pilot study that indicated widespread failure of public institutions to protect minorities before, during and after communal violence (106022). Researchers will examine the experience of survivors/victims in two locations (Gujarat and Orissa or Delhi) with respect to the following areas of state responsibility: the duty to prevent the outbreak of targeted mass violence; the duty to control violence effectively and protect all citizens regardless of their identities; the duty to provide adequate, fair and timely relief, rehabilitation and reparation to enable victims to rebuild their lives; and the duty to ensure that perpetrators are prosecuted and subjected to due process of criminal law. The project is expected to produce fresh insight into how state institutions can be held accountable in the aftermath of mass violence, and prepare the ground for a just policy and binding national norms on compensation, relief and rehabilitation.

But, recurring episodes of communal violence during and since Partition have given rise to the perception that the Government of India is unwilling to hold perpetrators and complicit public officials accountable for their actions against minorities. This project will build on the findings of a pilot study that indicated widespread failure of public institutions to protect minorities before, during and after communal violence (106022). Researchers will examine the experience of survivors/victims in two locations (Gujarat and Orissa or Delhi) with respect to the following areas of state responsibility: the duty to prevent the outbreak of targeted mass violence; the duty to control violence effectively and protect all citizens regardless of their identities; the duty to provide adequate, fair and timely relief, rehabilitation and reparation to enable victims to rebuild their lives; and the duty to ensure that perpetrators are prosecuted and subjected to due process of criminal law. The project is expected to produce fresh insight into how state institutions can be held accountable in the aftermath of mass violence, and prepare the ground for a just policy and binding national norms on compensation, relief and rehabilitation. It will also help specify what changes to the law are required to make public officials more accountable and reduce their immunity to prosecution.

The projects under this initiative will investigate issues surrounding women's participation in political decision-making, the judiciary and the public sector, and explore ways in which state institutions, political parties, civil society and kin-based social organizations can be influenced to advance women's choices and entitlements as citizens, including through increased representation.

A previous IDRC-supported research project on Dalit women's rights and citizenship in India (104939) showed that Dalit women are not ""just like"" other women in the way they experience discrimination. They are also subject to caste-based exclusion that deprives them of opportunities to escape poverty and denies them a voice to claim their rights. This grant will take the work further by examining the impact of Dalit women's political participation on economic and social policy outcomes affecting their constituencies, communities and families. The results are expected to initiate serious debate in policy and academic circles on Dalit women's political participation and representation, and serve as a baseline for future studies.

In Punjab, which produces more than half of India's annual food grain production, there is rising uncertainty in the timing of the rainy season. This - combined with large state subsidies for the use of electricity in irrigation - has prompted farmers to increase their reliance on water drawn from deep aquifers and pay scant attention to irrigation scheduling based on climate and meteorological information. The result is declining groundwater levels and, for low-income farmers without direct access to electricity, increased food insecurity.

This project aims to engage farmers, corporations and the state agricultural extension program in making better use of meteorological information to optimize water and energy use, and reduce pressure on overexploited aquifers. While previous work has targeted higher income farmers, this work will focus on lower income groups.

Researchers will assess the vulnerability of the food production system to water scarcity; use seasonal climate forecasts to guide irrigation scheduling, fertilizer application and crop choice; optimize the use of agricultural technology to improve water use efficiency; and make use of mobile phone technology to facilitate an exchange of information between farmers and planners. The project is expected to result in policy recommendations aimed at promoting sustainable resource management and facilitating access to resources by low-income farmers.

The UN Guidelines are soft or nonbinding law instruments, but they have been influential, The Guidelines have, with adaptations, been adopted into law in many developing countries.
The emergence and spread of digital technologies has resulted in new opportunities and challenges for consumers. There is need to amend the UN Guidelines in light of these developments.

To help women in countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and post-war Sri Lanka overcome these and other barriers to political participation, this research focuses on women's specific concerns in conflict zones. 

Research will document two critical challenges women face when trying to influence governance practices in conflict zones:
the impact of strong state security across all South Asian conflict zones, which often creates higher threats to women's physical security and sexual integrity; a culture of impunity among security forces, and a lack of justice for victims of violence and abuse. 

The research study will explore how women's marginalization in politics in South Asian conflict zones is due to governance practices, the political economy underpinning conflict, and local cultural norms rather than to the number of women in governance bodies. It underscores that while a quota strategy is an important way to ensure women's voice and agency in politics, it is inadequate.

The research will bring together researchers, women's groups, women's rights activists, policymakers, the media, non-governmental organizations, and others in three workshops in each of the four countries. A colloquium will be held to explore ways in which women's activism could have a stronger impact on governance and security policy through local and regional networks. Regional workshops and a monograph to share research findings among groups are also planned.","2",NA,"2015-05-01","2012-05-01","","Centre for Women's Development Studies",NA,"Regional NGO",23,"Canada.

The cost of coping with serious disease can be ruinous for families living below the poverty line. The Rajiv Aarogyasri Health Insurance Scheme was established in Andrha Pradesh to mitigate catastrophic healthcare expenses for enrolled families, and to ensure that the target population has access to quality health services for serious illnesses.
Aarogyasri currently covers more than 80% of the population of Andrha Pradesh. As one of the first schemes of its kind at this scale, Aarogyasri has generated national and international interest. A detailed evaluation is critical not only to keep improving the scheme, but also to ensure that the lessons learned from it benefit other states and countries. 
The Aarogyasri Trust Board has therefore asked a consortium of institutions to evaluate the scheme and consider its potential role in prevention and primary healthcare. This project is a response to that request. The evaluation will also establish a baseline for future evaluations, identify areas for further research, and build capacity for research, evaluation and evidence-based policymaking in India.","4",NA,"","2011-09-30","2013-05-30","Administrative Staff College of India",NA,"Foundation",60,"Canada.

However, flaws in the current international financial architecture and weak financial institutions in the developing world may constrain the ability of developing economies to take advantage of these opportunities. Moreover, demographic changes can lead to changes in capital accumulation and savings, and these can aggravate global financial imbalances and increase developed countries' public debt. The financial crisis and the absence of a reliable global liquidity safety net have increased incentives toward protectionism, thus reducing the chance that the window of opportunity provided by demographic change can be used effectively.

The conference will examine the implementation challenges that influence the large degree of regional disparities in gender equality achievements in India.

Conference delegates will explore several questions: What are the reasons for these disparities? Why are some states doing better than others? Do patriarchal practices and women's subordination in specific regions hinder success? What impact does women's level of involvement in local self-government have on service delivery? Can government officials demonstrate greater innovations in governance, accountability, and delivery structures? 

The conference will bring together researchers, academics, and representatives from NGOs and state women and child development departments. It will offer a critical look at strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and constraints in addressing gender equality outcomes. Research papers will identify and map distinctions between gender outcomes across states and reflect on the effectiveness of current national and state interventions.

The nano-particles in this project are developed from agricultural waste products, namely the natural fibres extracted from coconut husks and banana plants, creating new income opportunities for small-scale entrepreneurs, particularly women. The project is also building links with the private sector for biodegradable packaging materials.

Researchers expect to adapt the technologies developed in this project to other economically important horticultural crops, including flowers, and vegetables. Benefits for the soft fruit industry, such as berries, can also be extended to Canada.

This project will explore how to implement these kinds of strategies to maximize health and economic benefits while minimizing potential adverse consequences. Although many studies suggest that fiscal and regulatory approaches can be beneficial, questions remain whether they could have unintended consequences for public health or economic development in India. 

For example, would reducing salt intake cause greater iodine deficiency, already a significant risk among rural populations? Will taxes on high-sugar foods negatively affect the economy? How will reducing subsidies to palm oils and increasing subsidies for alternative oils affect food supplies? Will tobacco taxation cause an increase in cardiovascular disease deaths if users switch from taxed cigarettes to bidis (a popular, thin Indian-manufactured cigarette)? 

Researchers will develop mathematical models designed to simulate fiscal and regulatory strategies. They will incorporate recently collected survey data of disease risk and consumer purchasing into the models to determine optimal strategies.

But today, emerging economies are beginning to make their mark: these new, emerging donors are an increasingly important source of financial flows into poor countries. India, for example, is among the top five donors to Afghanistan. Understanding what motivates emerging donors is of interest to both recipient countries and members of the established donor community. 

This grant supports a comparative study of the emerging foreign aid programs of India and China. The study analyzes these programs in the context of the international aid regime and each country's long-term economic and foreign policy strategies. The study will be jointly undertaken by Indian and Chinese scholars. 

Both countries tend to operate on the basis of regional and international power politics and their own national interests in pursuing aid policies, particularly vis-à-vis their neighbours. While the aid policies of these countries have garnered attention, there is, as yet, little understanding of their systems and strategies. This study addresses this gap by updating data on each country's foreign assistance and mapping the institutions involved, the beneficiaries, the sectors they are investing in, and their funding approaches. It also examines the underlying philosophy that guides each country's foreign assistance policies.","4",NA,"","2012-03-29","2014-02-28","University of Pennsylvania Institute for the Advanced Study of India",NA,"National NGO",22,"Canada.

In late 2010, the United Nations' (UN) Special Rapporteur, Margaret Sekaggya, embarked on a fact-finding mission to assess the situation of human rights defenders in India. Based on her travels to New Delhi, Bhubaneshwar (Orissa), Kolkata (West Bengal), Guwahati (Assam), 
Ahmedabad (Gujarat), Jammu, and Srinagar (Jammu and Kashmir), she reported that that while India faces serious security challenges, the use of security laws at the national and state levels - most notably the Public Security Act, the Armed Forces (Special) Powers Act, the Public Safety Act, and the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act - compromise citizens' human rights. This grant will help to document how this situation is affecting women in India.

In recent years, bodies such as the UN have come to accept that modern armed conflicts have a strong impact on women and girls, even though they are generally not directly engaged in combat. After the Bosnian and Rwanda conflicts, the UN Security Council introduced Resolution 1325, -adopted in October 2000, stating that it was important, in the future, to ensure that women's needs and views be part of conflict prevention, peace processes, peacekeeping operations, and recovery when conflicts end. Because the resolution's objectives remained mostly ""on paper"" and were not being integrated as intended, the UN's Special Rapporteur completed her tour of India in 2010. 

Long years of conflict in various parts of India have left communities bereft of peace and development that they rightfully deserve. The support this funding provides will increase knowledge of the impacts that certain Indian laws and security policies are having on women.

Longitudinal village studies are enjoying a revival among researchers. This may be because they are uniquely equipped to provide insight into long-term economic, social, and political transformations in villages. In particular, such studies can shed light on the processes that underlie unequal growth and the effect this has on rural groups. From a policy perspective, longitudinal village studies improve people's understanding of cause-and-effect in village settings, and may help to define or develop future policy choices.

Many discussions about inclusive growth in India increasingly focus on the fact that rural areas and villages can no longer be ignored. Scholars working on longitudinal village studies in Pakistan and Bangladesh, along with other South Asian countries, may be able to learn from India's experiences as well as their own, since the contexts are often similar. 

The planned conference will bring together about 25 researchers (with a few doctoral students) from various disciplines, and about five people from policy circles. Their gathering in the fall of 2012 will allow them to share learning from the rich and complex data that has emerged from longitudinal village studies.

While the causes and scale of conflict vary in each country, a widespread pattern of human rights violations has emerged. This research support project aims to develop a research agenda to examine state impunity and improve international norms and standards in the region. 

State responses to conflict in these countries has involved enacting counter-terrorism measures that may include

- enacting emergency laws
- imposing laws that do not meet constitutional and international standards 
- imposing martial law (directly or implied) 
- employing military and paramilitary forces against civilians beyond the normal rules of justice, and
- suspending fundamental rights without any access to remedies.  

These types of responses have led to violations of human rights that are often identified as crimes under international law. The violations may include acts such as torture, killings not sanctioned by law or the justice system, and enforced disappearances. 

This lack of accountability has been dubbed a ""spiral of impunity."" It has a negative impact on the region's stability and undermines efforts to build democratic institutions among South Asia governments. 

Legal and human rights experts in South Asia want to develop a research agenda to examine problems of enforced disappearance and illegal state actions in conflict zones in their countries.

Experts attending this brainstorming meeting aim to develop an analysis to challenge state impunity in the region and to deepen international norms and standards in South Asia. The three-day meeting will review commissioned country background papers on enforced disappearances and impunity and produce a paper identifying gaps in knowledge and proposals for future work.","4",NA,"","2012-03-19","2013-10-18","Institute for Development Education and Learning (IDEAL)",NA,"National NGO",22,"Canada.

Increasing urbanization in India and a desire among middle- and high-income classes for ""world-class"" cities has caused slums to be evicted on a large scale. Women and youth are most seriously affected when it comes to loss of shelter, jobs in the informal sector, basic services, and access to welfare. Their attempts to resist slum demolitions are often hampered by a lack of information about government policies, a lack of skills to convert knowledge into action, and difficulty getting wider support for their campaigns.

Since 1997, the Hazards Centre - a wing of the Sanchal Foundation - has helped community groups, labour organizations, and development agencies deal with issues such as slum governance, health, education, shelter, jobs, and environmental protection. One of the central findings of the Hazard Centre is that community groups can make great strides when they share their experiences. 

To this end, IDRC will support seven visits among representatives of target community groups in cities across India in 2012. The people visiting others l will include homeless people, informal waste pickers, migrants from minority and marginalized groups, and informal sector workers, such as casual labourers, skilled artisans, hawkers, and rickshaw pullers.
  
The cities involved are Delhi, Hyderabad, Pune, Mumbai, and Bengaluru. Four of the visits will see Delhi groups going to other cities, and three others will involve groups from other cities visiting Delhi or other cities. Each visit will average three days. Ten people selected by their communities will participate in each visit. 

The goal is for urban slum dwellers to share successful ways to resist and survive displacement. The visits are also expected to reduce each group's sense of isolation and alienation.","4",NA,"","2012-03-20","2013-06-11","Sanchal Foundation",NA,"Regional NGO",23,"Canada.

It aims to shape policies underlying the development of India's proposed National Food Security Act. As well, it will help restructure the public food distribution system and the delivery of social welfare programs that affect food and nutritional security. 

The project's two streams are led by the National Council for Applied Economic Research (India) and the Institute of Development Studies (United Kingdom). The first stream will analyze national data sets to examine the magnitude and distribution of malnutrition, how income and dietary compositions affect nutrition, the different effects on women and men, and how nutrition is connected to water, sanitation, and hygiene. The second stream of the project will analyze policy needs for designing and implementing nutrition-focused initiatives. 

These projects will establish research gaps and lead to the commissioning of 15 to18 research articles analyzing identified needs. Those articles will feed into policy development through briefs, website content for the Institute of Development Studies, other online platforms, and the publication of an edited book and/or journal issue. A symposium in India will share research results with key policymakers, researchers, civil society, and the media in order to highlight the issue of malnutrition in the country and spur action.","3",NA,"","2012-07-01","2015-03-04","Institute of Development Studies",NA,"National NGO",22,"Canada.

This open government data movement can foster greater civic participation and promote new business opportunities.

Worldwide, governments have posted an estimated one-million datasets on the Internet. A small fraction of these datasets comes from developing countries, but this is changing rapidly. Citizens in Brazil, Nepal, and Nigeria can now use publicly available government budget data to track and fight corruption. Developers and entrepreneurs across Latin America, Africa, and Asia can create Web and mobile applications using government data on education, health, and crime to promote smarter and more efficient local public services.

In the developed world, open government data has delivered economic benefits. The re-use of public sector data in the Eurozone generated EUR32 billion in 2010. A UK study valued the economic impact of open government data at GBP6 billion per year. Qualitative evidence shows that open data can stem corruption and increase accountability. Much less is known about its impact in the developing world.

Open government data offers the potential for greater government accountability, efficiency, and transparency in the developing world. It can also create new economic opportunities for all segments of society. However, rigorous evidence on the use, outcomes, and impact of these objectives remains scarce. Those responsible for funding and implementing these programs must understand emerging best practices. They must also have insight into the varying impacts of open data in strikingly different social, economic, and cultural contexts. 

This project will help create a research network to explore the implications of releasing government data. More specifically, it will aim to:

-generate research on the emerging impacts of open data interventions
-deliver policy and practice findings that can inform local and global debates
-build research capacity worldwide to explore the emerging impacts of open data.

The World Wide Web Foundation will administer the proposed research network. The organization promotes and supports an Internet that is open, usable, and valuable for everyone, particularly developing countries. It will include 18 partners in Latin America, Africa, and Asia who will undertake case studies to assess existing initiatives, challenges, emerging outcomes, and impacts. 

The research will address key issues and gaps in knowledge. For example, well-intentioned open data initiatives may cause adverse effects by exacerbating social or economic inequalities. They can favour well-resourced groups that are more capable of extracting value from the data for their own economic and political gain. Commercial elites in Bangalore, for example, have used the digitization of land records to find gaps in title and errors in documentation to gain ownership of land occupied by poor communities.

The project will also develop data collection instruments to help explain if and how open data is bringing change to developing countries. It will engage policymakers at global and local levels to foster robust evidence-based practice in this emerging policy area.","2",NA,"2015-08-01","2013-02-01","","World Wide Web Foundation",NA,"National NGO",22,"Canada.

According to recent National Crime Bureau data, a rape happens every 26 minutes, molestation every 14 minutes, dowry death every 63 minutes, and acts of cruelty by husband and relatives every 6 minutes. 

Charge-sheets are filed in 92% of these cases, but the conviction rate is 27%. For cases of reported rape, the conviction rate is even lower, suggesting high levels of impunity. While strong laws are in place, justice eludes the victims.

This project aims to provide women who are victims of violence with greater access to justice and more equitable power within the criminal legal system. By uncovering lacunae in the law and developing protocols for better legal implementation, it will contribute to ending impunity for such crimes. 

An innovative methodology will document approximately 150 victims' experience of accessing justice for rape and domestic violence while the cases play out in the family, community, police station, and court rooms. 

In addition, the project will study how domestic violence law works for ordinary women in the 35 urban and rural districts of Maharashtra. It will also look at positive court rulings in domestic violence cases and analyze these for use by judges and prosecutors.

This project is the first of its kind and findings are likely to have a major impact on policy and programs.

As many as 32% of Indians consume alcohol, with 4% to 13% consuming it daily. While per capita alcohol consumption has fallen since 1980 in most developed countries, it has risen over 115% in India. While excessive alcohol consumption has become a health, social, and developmental concern, there is little research in India on how taxation affects alcohol consumption. 

This project proposes to fill this critical gap and to help Indian policymakers develop effective alcohol control policies. The Public Health Foundation of India will carry out the research. The research team will study trends in alcohol taxation and pricing policies across 10 selected Indian states and analyze their linkages with alcohol expenditure patterns and consumption over 12 years (from 2001 to 2012). 

Researchers will use econometric models to estimate price and taxation elasticities-or how changing one economic variable will affect others. These estimates will account for specific beverages and differences between rural and urban populations. The controlled analysis will include a series of state-level and household-level confounders (extraneous or hidden variables). They will collect data from multiple sources, including the National Sample Survey Office of India and the 10 state excise tax departments. 

Based on the results, researchers will recommend evidence-based alcohol taxation policies suited to the Indian context. They will disseminate the results through scientific papers, media briefs, and policy briefs for legislators, administrators, and alcohol control advocates in India, as well as throughout South and Southeast Asia.","2",NA,"","2013-07-08","2015-04-20","Public Health Foundation of India",NA,"Regional NGO",23,"Canada.

In addition, growth in emerging economies in the coming 10-to-15 years will likely result in sizable increases in aid-like flows from these countries, further changing the traditional aid landscape. 

Despite these trends, there is currently no systematic collection or dissemination of these flows. This project will measure and analyze four types of financial flows - official development assistance, global philanthropy, remittances and private capital investment - to the developing world by Brazil, India, China, South Africa, and other selected emerging economies.

Deriving best possible estimates for South-South flows will fill an important gap in development thinking and policy by providing information on the amount and types of financial flows. The data and analysis will inform current thinking on the role of so-called ""new donors"" and private actors, and suggest areas where future research is warranted. 

The trends extracted from the research will be useful to donors, emerging economies and developing countries alike in understanding these changing dynamics. Results of the research will be published in the Center for Global Prosperity's annual Index of Global Philanthropy and Remittances, and will comprise the focus of the 2013 publication. Results will also be disseminated through seminars, the Center for Global Prosperity blog, targeted media outreach, op-eds, and white papers.","4",NA,"","2012-09-05","2014-07-31","Hudson Institute,",NA,"National NGO",22,"Canada.

Awareness is also growing about the fact that the exclusion of women and the lack of gender expertise in negotiations lead to setbacks for women that are difficult to reverse. These setbacks often deprive them of access to justice, reparations, economic opportunity, and security.

This project will provide support for the conference, ""The Changing Dynamics of Peacebuilding in South Asia: Recasting Women's Agency and Transformative Strategies."" The conference will aim to generate knowledge about women's participation in peace processes and post-conflict reconstruction.  

South Asia has a rich history of peacebuilding. It offers valuable lessons on strategies that have worked to enhance women's participation in political settlements and peace processes. There is a need for researchers to examine these important experiments in women's participation to understand whether they lead to strong outcomes. Sri Lanka has a gender subcommittee, which ensures women's participation at the peace table. Nepal offers an example of how women elected to the Constituent Assembly are shaping that country's constitution. They represent a cross-section of class, caste, and ethnicity in Nepal. The key question, however, is whether these inclusive processes actually led to inclusive outcomes.

The South Asia conference will examine the gendered challenges confronting peacebuilding and post-conflict reconstruction. Senior South Asian academics and practitioners will lead the program, which will:
-respond to the complex challenges confronting women building peace and empowerment in contexts of violent conflict; 
-document contributions that have been overlooked in formal negotiations; and, 
-consider mechanisms that will enable women to have an impact on peacebuilding and reconstruction.","4",NA,"","2013-01-11","2014-06-17","South Asia Forum for Human Rights Limited",NA,"National NGO",22,"Canada.

However, the tribunal has run into serious trouble with allegations of misconduct and concerns over a lack of fair trial safeguards.

This project will help address this situation and will provide funding for Bangladeshi scholars and human rights practitioners to begin a national consultation process. The aim is to build consensus among public intellectuals on a legitimate justice process to address the crimes committed during the liberation of Bangladesh in 1971.  

As the country marked the 40th anniversary of liberation, the War Crimes Criminal Tribunal was to hold a historic trial against the perpetrators responsible for killing thousands of people, including hundreds of secular intellectuals, just before the liberation on December 16, 1971. 

When the War Crimes Tribunal was activated in 2012, it began prosecuting the cases involving the Pakistani army and their local collaborators. Today, a number of cases are awaiting verdicts. However, the trial process is now in question. 

In December 2012, the presiding tribunal judge resigned amid criticism of his conduct. The tribunal is trying 10 opposition politicians on charges of arson, rape, and other atrocities committed during the war of independence from Pakistan. Opposition political parties mounted campaigns against the tribunal, terming it a political plot to discredit the opposition. Amnesty International also claimed that the International Crimes Tribunal Act of 1973, and its 2009 amendment, under which the trials in Bangladesh are being held, lacks ""adequate fair trial safeguards.""

As the trial process has come under an increasingly hostile campaign at home and abroad, the fear is that the long-awaited moment for survivors and their families to see justice is once again at risk. Public intellectuals, researchers, human rights practitioners, women's rights activists, and concerned citizens in Bangladesh and other parts of South Asia are trying to keep the demand for justice alive. They are pointing to concrete legal and procedural measures which such tribunals should adhere to in order to preserve the legitimacy of the process. International human rights groups are also contributing to the process so that the trials are fair and impartial.

Conducting research on the subject is fraught with ethical and methodological challenges because there are safety and confidentiality concerns for respondents. There is also social stigma and fear among survivors. As a result, there is little reliable social research on violence against women in India. Existing feminist analysis is often based on a small number of case studies. Although India's National Crime Records Bureau presents annual data on violence against women, it is drawn from police records and does not go beyond reporting statistics. There is a gap in knowledge about how violence plays out in the lives of women and how institutions respond in crisis situations.

This research project aims to produce an evidence-based analysis of domestic violence and sexual assault in India to assist with building a comprehensive, gender-sensitive healthcare response to sexual assault. India does not include domestic violence in health policy or public health programs. This analysis will help support ongoing advocacy, policy-making, and public interventions. The Centre for Enquiry Into Health and Allied Themes (CEHAT), a research centre of Anusandhan Trust, will lead the project, analyze data, and write papers for peer-reviewed journals. 

In 2000, CEHAT collaborated with the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai to establish a response to domestic violence at a public hospital. This initiative, known as ""Dilaasa,"" was the first attempt to make accountable and sensitize India's health sector to the issue of violence against women. Dilaasa trained healthcare providers to recognize and respond to women reporting violence. A crisis intervention department was established where women facing domestic violence could receive psychosocial support. 

To sustain the programs, a core group of doctors and nurses was selected to train their peers on how to respond to women seeking help. The training was offered to professionals in five hospitals and led to the emergence of a committed group of about 60 health professionals. They raised concerns about the need for a comprehensive response to survivors of sexual violence. They observed that the protocols for examination were not systematic across the hospitals and that doctors had no training in this area. 

CEHAT seized the opportunity to establish a model for providing comprehensive services to sexual assault survivors at three of the hospitals that received a substantial number of survivors of sexual assault. This intervention produced rich empirical data from 2,400 case studies of women facing domestic violence and 100 sexual assault survivors. Data on burn cases taken from the hospital register and crisis centre records was also mined for analysis.

CEHAT will analyze this data and write papers for peer-reviewed journals. The papers will help ensure that the analysis is translated into scientific evidence to support policy planning and gender-sensitive health sector action that responds to gender-based violence.","4",NA,"","2013-04-23","2014-09-05","Trustees of Anusandhan Trust",NA,"Regional NGO",23,"Canada.

India faces another important health challenge: open defecation. With 575 million people in rural areas or 69% of the rural population and 18% of urban dwellers with no access to clean, safe toilet facilities, open defecation and malnourishment are issues with huge implications for nutrition, water, sanitation, and hygiene.

This project will allow researchers to critically assess the linkages between nutrition, water, sanitation, and hygiene to inform policy and program design in India. A team of water, sanitation, and hygiene specialists at UNICEF will lead the project.

Stunting depends on food intake, general health status, and the physical environment. Access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene systems and services is critically linked to all three factors that influence stunting. When young children and infants ingest faecal matter, it causes infection or diarrhea. Worse yet, it severely undermines a child's nutrition status and can cause irreparable damage to long-term physical and cognitive growth.

There is little evidence available globally to assess the impact of improved water, sanitation, and hygiene on reducing stunting. UNICEF's conceptual framework (1990) on the causes of under-nutrition makes it clear that nutritional status is a function of access to food, care practices, health services, and an environment without faecal matter. 

There is a lack of inter-sectoral evidence on program interventions or best practices which have had an impact on child malnutrition. UNICEF itself addresses nutritional gains separately from its evaluation of how improved water, sanitation, and hygiene contribute to health. More importantly, there is limited gender-specific data, particularly in India. Without a clear understanding of how gender inequality intersects with access to water, sanitation, food, and nutritional security, researchers cannot provide full analysis and policy recommendations.

This project will allow researchers to review all available secondary data, both quantitative and qualitative, to better understand the correlations and links between improved water, sanitation, and health and nutrition across different socio-economic groups in India. 

The research team will write a chapter for a book on under-nutrition and public policy in India. They will also prepare an article for a peer-reviewed journal. UNICEF will use the evidence to design advocacy and communication strategies and to influence programming on food and nutritional security in India.","4",NA,"","2013-03-01","2014-06-04","United Nations Children's Fund",NA,"Multilateral",40,"Canada.

Conflicts over access to water for agriculture do not happen in isolation. They cross sectors and needs. They include conflicts between access to drinking water and access to irrigation water. In India, the existing legal framework for dealing with these conflicts is conceptually sound, but loses potency when different needs simultaneously come into play. These result in contestations. The problem is largely based on India's sectoral understanding of water, which considers surface and groundwater rights separately. There are also distinct regulations for irrigation and drinking water supplies.

This project will examine the Rajsamand Lake dispute, which has been under judicial proceedings for several years. Researchers will collect primary data from a range of stakeholders and use secondary material to analyze this case study. The project will fill a key research gap. It will unearth and highlight the kinds of problems, both theoretical and empirical, which arise when various water rights clash-in this case, irrigation and drinking water.

It has emerged as one of the world's largest democracies. Its economy is growing. It is also an important regional power in Asia.

However, considerable weaknesses in its state institutions persist, restricting the country's ability to generate inclusive economic growth and political stability. Many state institutions, such as the judiciary, police force, public administration, and diplomatic corps, remain critically understaffed. They struggle to provide public services, and governance weaknesses are hampering them.

The goal is to share the research to help generate a public debate on ending impunity for human rights violations.

Researchers pieced together official, but unshared information collected through hundreds of Right to Information applications in India. The result is a public record for four cases of mass violence: 
- 1983 Nellie massacre in Assam; 
- 1984 anti-Sikh riots in New Delhi; 
- 1989 Bhagalpur violence between the Hindus and Muslims; and, 
- 2002 Gujarat violence between the Hindus and Muslims.

The researchers examined this violence on three specific dimensions of state accountability: 
- access to criminal justice;
- accountability of public officials; and, 
- compensation and rehabilitation. 

The public record of these events shines the light on governments, public authorities, and public institutions, allowing researchers to evaluate public officials' accountability and impunity after episodes of mass violence. This comparative study is significant in its use of Right to Information applications in human rights and points to their crucial relevance to contemporary governance debates around the notion of citizens' right to truth and justice. Distributing the report widely will contribute to ongoing discussions on justice and accountability.","2",NA,"2015-01-07","2013-03-07","","Centre for Equity Studies",NA,"Regional NGO",23,"Canada.

The publication and wider distribution of this study will help bridge the knowledge gap about development work with Muslims. The ultimate goal is to achieve national growth with equity by providing a crucial push toward minority development in India.

These acts of violence have instigated heated debates on issues ranging from sexual violence to women's rights, judicial and police reforms, juvenile justice, ideologies that glorify violence, non-violent resistance strategies, the displacement of indigenous people, panchayati raj (or self-governing) institutions, and the decentralization of governance. The most visible debates have played out in the electronic media, which tends to portray the issues in ""for or against"" terms. 

Serious discussions in public spaces and universities in metropolitan cities like New Delhi, which have better resources to plan and host debates, have taken place. However, youth and students from smaller cities such as Patna, Gaya, Lucknow, Allahabad, Jodhpur, and Jaipur have not been exposed to critical debates on these issues.

Once a thriving hub in the eyes of its inhabitants, it is now reduced to a neglected neighbourhood for which the government does not have a plan or vision. Joblessness, especially among youth, is increasing sharply as the local economy declines. New businesses are not being set up. The industrial estates, established decades ago, have closed. Government offices close regularly and are moving to the new city.

This project will empower disadvantaged urban youth in the Old City of Hyderabad by establishing a youth helpline and resource centre. The non-profit advocacy group, Yugantar, will lead the project. The organization has been working with youth from the Old City and has found that while there is a strong desire among youth and their parents for quality education and employment, there is little information on locally available opportunities. The resource centre and helpline will act as a focal point to help the disadvantaged access basic services, such as scholarships and government support. They will also serve as a knowledge hub for information on education and employment.

Poverty, discrimination are obstacles to youth employment
The challenges are particularly acute for young people. For many with educational certificates, the poor quality of their educational training makes it difficult, if not impossible, for them to get jobs with multinationals or big national firms. A large part of the population of the Old City has the double disadvantage of poverty and religion (many are Muslim). The Sachar Committee Report (2006) pointed out that Indian Muslims are not only lagging behind other socio-religious groups, but they also endure discrimination. This fuels a sense of injustice and alienation from mainstream society.

Hyderabad has a history of communal tensions. This has led to the near-complete ghettoization of many parts of the Old City. Mixed neighbourhoods have forcibly become single community areas often delineated by borders. These changes, combined with fractured families and traditional support structures, create ongoing tensions. They also increase feelings of insecurity, inhibit mobility, disable access to public spaces and institutions, and erode civic trust. There is an urgent need to help Old City youth in their social recovery by building their human, cultural, and social capital. This can best be done by leveraging technology to rebuild social and institutional networks, encouraging dialogue between community and state actors, and overcoming trauma and concerns.","4",NA,"","2013-12-09","2015-01-02","Yugantar",NA,"Regional NGO",23,"Canada.

The Centre for Equity Studies' (CES) shelter for men in the Yamuna Pushta area and the shelter for single women in the Jama Masjid community will provide psychosocial care and will give vulnerable people access to basic rights and public programs.

The Good Neighbour Project team selected the CES proposal to provide these rehabilitation programs. CES set up a National Resource Team for the Urban Homeless (HAUSLA) as part of its national campaign to address fundamental problems identified by the Supreme Court and the Hashim Committee Report on Urban Poor. 

While the Government of India has introduced schemes to help the homeless, the country lacks an adequate methodology to identify the poor and homeless. This makes it very difficult, and unlikely, that people who depend on public services to survive will access them. In many cases, the vulnerable lack proper government identification, such as birth certificates or ration cards. This problem further excludes them from welfare and development programs.

The project team will identify the homeless in Yamuna Pushta and Jama Masjid. They will provide access to basic services and rights. They also plan to document mental and emotional traumas that homeless people face as a result of long-term suffering-and provide counselling. 

The project funds will also help form a network for advocacy, services, and documentation on public health issues with other NGOs and special care providers working in the streets of Delhi. The network will allow these groups to pool knowledge and document problems. It is likely to result in better coordination between NGOs and between the NGOs and government departments. 

Information gathered through surveys and programs will be presented at a meeting between NGOs, agency representatives, and special care providers. The project will provide long-term benefits to marginalized groups, along with immediate care, relief, and life skills training.

The project's specific objectives include:

Despite the guarantees and rights given to them under the Indian Constitution, including a life of dignity that is free of discrimination, violence, and abuse, many children continue to face threats of sexual, physical, and emotional abuse. This project will address the problem by empowering local communities to create a violence-free environment for their children.

Sexual violence in Indian society
A recent Asian Centre for Human Rights report notes an alarming increase in reported rape cases against children in the decade from 2001 to 2011. National Crime Bureau (NCB) figures also show a similar increase in reported violent crimes against women and children. According to the report, the total crimes against women increased by 7.1% between 2010 and 2011. Rape shows an increase of 9.2%; 30% of these are child rape victims (about 11% under 14, and 19% between the ages of 14 and 18). 

Empowering children and families
This project addresses children's safety and security. It recognizes that there is a real need to make children, communities, and parents aware of the widespread nature of the abuse. It also empowers them with knowledge about their rights and responsibilities in mitigating sexual violence, giving children the childhood they deserve and that is enshrined in the constitution. 

The project will include a series of workshops on children's rights with the children and communities in Gujarat. The workshops will focus on abuse, its types, signs, symptoms, and prevention and protection strategies. The Peace and Equality Cell will co-lead the project with the Human Development and Research Centre of St. Xavier's Non-Formal Education Society. Both have an excellent track record of community-based work on child rights and women's rights in Gujarat. The workshops will equip participants with the knowledge and tools they need to report crimes of sexual violence and to access the support and legal services available to them under the existing legislation for most marginalized children.","4",NA,"","2014-02-26","2015-04-02","[Director] for and on behalf of St. Xavier's Non-Formal Education Society",NA,"Regional NGO",23,"Canada.

This project will strengthen the Indian health sector's response to sexual violence by establishing sexual violence as a public health issue and by developing a comprehensive approach to deal with it.

Sexual violence in India
India's health systems are in a poor state to deal with sexual violence.  As a result, physical and psychological healing is not getting the policy attention that it deserves, despite several highly publicized incidents. In the absence of established protocols in the case of communal violence in Muzafarnagar, for example, neither the lawyers nor the civil society groups could help the victims get treatment. 

Several issues constrain the health sector's response in cases of sexual assault. These include a lack of guidelines for sexual assault examination and evidence collection, gender insensitive and unscientific methods for examination, and denial of treatment. Health providers often lack knowledge about their legal and ethical obligations toward sexual assault survivors. This hinders survivors' access to justice.

Research to address the gap
This research project will help develop awareness in India for a comprehensive response to sexual assault. It will bring together competent health professionals, community-based organizations, shelters, legal aid institutions, police, and public prosecutors to work on the problem. 

IDRC will collaborate with the following organizations:
-Public Health Foundation of India;
-Centre for Enquiry Into Health and Allied Themes; and
-Partners in Law and Development.

Together, they will address the issue through workshops, background papers, and a position document.

This project will:
-commission papers to review existing state and national policy approaches;
-highlight concrete gaps in design and implementation of health services for sexual assault survivors;
-bring survivors' health rights within law and policy;
-develop an accountability framework to ensure that policies are implemented; and
-share the results of this effort.","2",NA,"2015-08-27","2014-02-27","","International Development Research Centre",NA,"Other Public Sector",15,"Canada.

This project will allow the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER), a Think Tank Initiative grantee institution in India, to develop a model to analyze India's macroeconomy.

Why analyzing the economy is important
Macroeconomic analyses serve to inform policy. They bring benefits by helping to project changes that take place because of shocks to the economy caused by policy decisions or other factors. 

A range of applied economic tools, such as time series models or econometric models that build on simple statistical properties, have been used to provide these types of analyses. However, there is now an increasing body of economic literature that attempts to build economic models based on a more comprehensive and theoretically consistent framework. 

About the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium model
The Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) modelling framework is an approach that combines a rational and dynamic view of economic agents

The DSGE framework proposed for this project will consider a prototype economy that emerges from the sum of individual choices and decisions. The key economic agents are households, firms, the government, and the central bank. All behave according to their own preferences and views about the future, subject to random shocks. 

The framework provides a coherent structure to analyze economic fluctuations. In recent years, research has shown that estimated DSGE models can generate forecasts with greater accuracy in comparison to time series models. DSGE models are increasingly used in central banking. 

A model for the Indian economy
This proposal seeks to develop a DSGE model for the Indian economy to complement a range of tools available at the NCAER. The model developed through this project will be a pioneering effort in India. 

NCAER is planning the project in two phases: 
-Phase 1: Researchers will develop a model for India based on a review of the relevant literature and consultations. They will develop a database for estimating purposes. 
-Phase 2: Researchers will estimate the model, operationalize it, and validate it through alternative sets of simulations.","4",NA,"","2014-08-30","2014-10-30","National Council of Applied Economic Research",NA,"Foundation",60,"Great Britain.

This project will address the problem by allowing participants to explore cash transfer challenges and opportunities at a round table. Participants will examine the feasibility of a social policy on basic income for Tribal and Scheduled Castes. These castes, known as the Dalits, are two historically disadvantaged groups recognized in the Indian constitution. 

Cash transfer positions
Those who support cash transfers believe that cash is better than in-kind benefits because it is more efficient to deliver and less vulnerable to leakages. Leakage takes place when recipients do not need what is provided to them. Opponents feel that people will not use the cash for basic needs, so it is better to deliver commodities and services directly after fixing leakages in the system. 

Cash transfer pilot study
It is against this backdrop that India's Self Employed Women's Association (SEWA) undertook a research pilot to study the potential of unconditional cash transfers. Conducted in Indore district, the pilot study included two experiments. In the first, researchers studied 20 general villages. In the second, they studied a Bhil tribal village. In both cases, they chose equal numbers of control villages where no cash transfers were made. 

In the first experiment, adults received a modest amount of 200 rupees (CA$3.60) and children were given 100 rupees (CA$1.80) for twelve months. The research team increased the amounts to 300 rupees (CA$5.40) and 150 rupees (CA$2.70) respectively during the five-month extension period. 

Results add to the cash transfer debate
The SEWA project's findings have interesting implications for debates on cash transfers in India. Researchers observed that recipients did not spend the cash on liquor, but used it effectively to make a difference in their lives. Many got out of debt bondage, while others moved from casual wage labour to self-employment. 

There were other positive effects in education, health, and nutrition. These were more pronounced for the more vulnerable sections of society, especially members of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe. SEWA's findings suggest that for the Tribal and Dalit populations, a social policy of basic income would be more effective than the variety of schemes currently in use. 

Round table to explore options
The proposed round table will allow policymakers, administrators, academics, and practitioners working on this issue to discuss the pilot project's findings, ideas around basic incomes, and the feasibility of a social policy on basic income for Tribal and Scheduled Castes. 
It is hoped that the round table will contribute to deepening the debates on the concept of basic income for Tribals and Dalits, as well as inform policymakers at the state and central levels about basic income.

The project's activities will also include:
-developing two technical papers on the impact of basic income payments on Tribal and Scheduled Caste households;
-disseminating the pilot study's findings;
-trying to build consensus on the concept of basic income for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes; and
-encouraging the state and central governments to consider using Tribal Sub Plan and other government funds for implementing basic income, at least on a pilot basis.

Ninguna otra enfermedad ha obligado a los afectados a dejar sus familias y comunidades y vivir como proscritos. Para los afectados, vencer la infección no es suficiente para poder volver a su forma de vida previa. La OMS calcula que hay 3 millones de discapacitados en el mundo a causa de la lepra. India es el país del mundo que más casos nuevos presenta (133.717 casos nuevos en 2009, de los cuales, 47.361, mujeres). La lepra es una enfermedad excluyente social y económicamente por (1) sus efectos discapacitantes que llevan a la amputación de extremidades y ceguera, y (2) por el estigma, que afecta tanto a enfermos como a sus familias. Hasta la fecha se ha prestado poca atención a las cuestiones de género y los proyectos muchas veces se han inclinado a favorecer a los hombres. De hecho, la lepra puede tener mayor impacto en las mujeres que son las que con más probabilidad tienen de ser excluidas de familia y comunidad. Con este proyecto pretendemos dar a conocer la realidad que viven las mujeres afectadas por la lepra en India y como se ven automáticamente relegadas de los contextos laborales o sociales y acaban viviendo de la mendicidad. La propuesta pretende dar a conocer el impacto de la pobreza en estas mujeres, a través de de testimonios personales en formato de libro y una campaña de sensibilización dirigida a la sociedad valenciana que de a conocer esta realidad.","3","2011-08-18","2013-02-18",NA,NA,"CCAA VAL - C.

El riego por goteo ha supuesto un importantísimo avance al conseguir la humedad en el sistema radicular aportando gota a gota el agua necesaria para el desarrollo de la planta. Al acotar la superficie humedecida, las raíces limitan su expansión a ese espacio y no a otro. Otra característica, consecuencia de esta modalidad de riego, es el mayor aprovechamiento de las tierras ya que, al concentrar la humedad en pequeñas bolsas, se crean espacios secos que dan la oportunidad a un planteamiento de aprovechamiento del suelo mucho más racional e intensivo.""""

La particular evolución de la comunidad tibetana en el exilio ha sido posible gracias a la política del gobierno indio que, por un lado, facilitó la rehabilitación a largo plazo de la población tibetana refugiada y por otro, concedió total autonomía a su forma de organización interna propiciando la supervivencia de la cultura tibetana en el exilio, hoy por hoy amenazada de extinción en el Tíbet ocupado. El proyecto pretende contribuir al desarrollo humano equitativo y sostenible de la población tibetana exiliada en la India. Para ello se plantea una intervención en dos fases. En esta primera fase se propone formar en género, salud y medio ambiente y empoderar a hombres y mujeres de los asentamientos tibetanos más empobrecidos de India, con la finalidad de que identifiquen sus necesidades comunitarias desde la perspectiva de la equidad social, de género y la sostenibilidad. En una segunda fase las necesidades identificadas se trasladarán a los representantes regionales de cada asentamiento. Para llevar a cabo esta primera fase del proyecto, se plantean las siguientes actividades: - Realización de talleres (género, violencia doméstica, medio ambiente y cambio climático y salud y medio ambiente). Los talleres se realizarán en los 5 asentamientos identificados, tendrán una duración de uno ó dos días y se espera una participación de al menos el 70% de mujeres. - Los y las participantes en los talleres deberán realizar acciones de educación popular en sus comunidades. - Crear en cada comunidad una comisión formada por 4 mujeres y 2 hombres, responsables de realizar un diagnóstico participativo. - Llevar a cabo una acción de sensibilización en los municipios que financien el proyecto, bajo el título ?Tíbet en el exilio: papel de las mujeres en el conflicto?. Esta jornada constará de una conferencia, la proyección de un documental y una exposición fotográfica.

En La India, la educación secundaria está lejos de ser accesible a todos los sectores de la población, aún peor en zonas rurales. Los escasos recursos de las familias (dálits, tribales y castas bajas), la lejanía de los centros y sus precarias condiciones, no facilitan la formación de personas cualificadas. El gobierno local (Panchayat) de la aldea de Lepakshi y el Comité de Desarrollo del Bachillerato (que cubre toda la comarca/mandal rural de Lepakshi), en colaboración con RDT/WDT, han identificado la educación secundaria pública como una prioridad para la zona. Para mejorar el acceso a una educación de calidad se considera urgente contar con nuevas instalaciones: 6 aulas, un laboratorio con dos salas y unos baños separados por sexo, punto de inflexión para la educación secundaria de las niñas. Se beneficiará a 150 alumnos y 153 alumnas, y una plantilla 14 profesores/as, y una inversión en los futuros estudiantes.

Para conseguir los objetivos esperados, se realizarán visitas a la zona rural, en las que se harán campañas de educación, y varias aportaciones de conocimiento tecnológico. - Granjas: cuando llueve, el agua no percola para ayudar a cultivar la tierra, en vez de ello, el agua se encharca. Por ello la solución es crear un lago artificial en el lugar y usar tecnología de pozos perforados para recargar el subsuelo y así ayudar al granjero a ser autosuficiente. - Colegios: Cientos de litros de aguas grises se pierden diariamente debido a la escorrentía en los colegios, causando condiciones inseguras para los niños. La solución que se aporta es instalar un colector de agua de lluvia cubierto para facilitar la recarga del subsuelo y el drenaje. - Industrias: los pozos perforados que existen se han secado debido a la escasa precipitación. Para ello se ha optado por implementar una planta con un colector agua de lluvia y procesada con compartimentos para colectar, filtrar y recargar los pozos. - Otros: hospitales, residencias personales y corporaciones.

La actividad consiste en 2 fases: Documentación y diagnostico de problemas: Contando con la colaboración de la Facultad de Ingeniería Civil se realizará un análisis de lugar en cuanto a calidades de los materiales utilizados, características constructivas empleadas,comportamiento climático de los inmuebles. Se llevará a cabo mediante trabajo de campo, observación. Se realizará un diagnostico del comportamiento actual de las construcciones desde el punto de vista de la Habitabilidad Básica incluyendo la eficiencia energética (estudio climático),realizando cálculos de las transmitancias (pérdidas de calor de los materiales) mediante programas como Climate Consultant y Archisun, apoyados con 3D Studio Max. También se analizarán las artesanías y las tecnologías del lugar. Propuesta de posibles soluciones: Hecho el diagnóstico y contando nuevamente con el apoyo de los estudiantes de la Facultad de Ingeniería Civil, se realizará la segunda fase del workshop donde poder realizar propuestas para la mejora de las condiciones habitacionales de las viviendas de distintas comunidades analizadas. El objetivo es el diseño de sistemas constructivos para la mejora de la vivienda reutilizando materiales y buscando la activación de la economía local. Todas las propuestas quedarán recogidas en un documento impreso que permita establecer los procesos de mejora de la vivienda, siguiendo la metodología empleada por Johan Van Lengen en ?Manual del arquitecto descalzo?, con la garantiza de haber desarrollado los diseños utilizando las tecnologías actuales y reparado para poder ser realizado por cualquier persona según los medios de los que disponga para su ejecución. El objetivo final: Conseguir sensibilizar en procesos de reutilización de materiales y uso tecnologías aplicadas en procesos de bioconstrucción. Con la aplicación de las tecnologías se podrá diseñar viviendas que cumplan las condiciones de Habitabilidad Básica. Mejorando desde el uso de materiales disponibles, hasta el planeamiento de los nuevos asentamientos, pasando por el desarrollo de las tecnologías locales, consiguiendo la autosuficiencia de recursos.","3","2013-10-17","2014-03-17",NA,NA,"UNIVERSIDADES","AC-57",NA,NA,"Spain",NA,"Government",10,"UNIV UPV - Universitat Politècnica de València","AC2-455",NA,NA,"UPV - Universidad Politécnica de Valencia","AC-682",NA,NA,"IN","India","100","679","South Asia, regional",NA,"16040","Low-cost housing","","","1",1,NA,10,"D02","4",NA,"EUR",1350,"1350","0","0",0,0,0

OBJETIVO ESPECÍFICO Garantizar el acceso a una vivienda digna a 49 familias dalits o de castas desfavorecidas y de escasos recursos de los pueblos de Kodavandlapalli y Nitturu, en las áreas de Narpala y Tadipatri, región de B.K. Samudram, distrito de Anantapur, India. POBLACIÓN BENEFICIARIA: En la India contemporánea existe una enorme masa de personas excluidas del sistema, los parias o intocables contemplados dentro del mencionado criterio de pureza como los más contaminados, que constituyen el estrato más bajo de la sociedad y realizan los trabajos más denostados. Este extenso grupo representa aproximadamente unos 160 millones de personas, que reciben el nombre de dálits (?oprimidos? en hindi). Así pues, en la India rural, los dálits constituyen una comunidad marginada y su trabajo como jornaleros, escasamente remunerado e irregular, impide su acceso a unas condiciones de vida dignas. En este contexto, la FVF trabaja para que los dálits, junto con otros grupos discriminados como los tribales y las backward castes, los sectores empobrecidos, se conviertan en los dueños de su propio destino y recuperen su dignidad. En Andhra Pradesh hay 12 grupos indígenas primitivos. Viven en las zonas boscosas de las regiones de Andhra y Telengana y en el bosque de Nallamala. En él habitan los chenchu, cerca de 8.000 familias que constituyen las comunidades nómadas más pobres del Estado. Viven aislados, dedicados a la caza y a la recolección, en dependencia directa del bosque y sin conocimientos ni costumbres vinculadas al cultivo agrícola.

Es proposa la construcció de 6 noves aules i un bloc de sanitaris. Segons UNICEF, el sistema educatiu de l?Índia s?enfronta a manca d?infraestructures, inadequat equipament de les escoles públiques, amuntegament d?alumnat, escàs professorat i amb poca formació baixa qualitat curricular i, per tant, baix nivell d?aprenentatge. Difícil continuïtat d?estudis de secundària,això suposa sobretot a les classes socials més humils una manca d?oportunitats i una permanència en la situació de forta precarietat. Les autoritats locals no poden invertir en les millores del centre, però es comprometen a garantir-ne el personal i el manteniment de les instal?lacions. Persones beneficiàries: 337 alumnes (142 nens/195 nenes). 20 personal de l?escola. Indirectes: la comunitat, 262.340 persones. El projecte ha estat sol?licitat per la direcció de l?escola i les famílies. La FVF ha valorat la petició, tenint en compte criteris especificats al projecte i tenint en compte que a la comunitat s?hagi fet un treball previ de cohesió i participació que garanteixin la capacitat d?autogestió.

Hoy en día miles de personas tratan de sobrevivir en las calles de Calcuta siendo la situación más penosa la de aquellas personas que padecen diferentes discapacidades físicas y/o intelectuales. Para intentar paliar esta situación, Calcuta Ondoan tiene dos centros con capacidad para 80 personas (uno para mujeres y otro para hombres). En ambos centros se intenta que vayan sintiéndolos como su hogar, un lugar donde se les escucha y atiende de manera adecuada, y no como un hospital. En una primera fase, médicos especializados vigilan la salud de las personas que ingresan en el centro, ya que generalmente suelen estar muy enfermas. Según progresa su estado físico, van incorporándose a las labores de mantenimiento del hogar, ayudando en la cocina, en las huertas o cuidando de los animales de la granja. Una vez que están totalmente recuperadas se procura que puedan reinsertarse y volver con sus familias, aunque esto no es posible en todos los casos.

Con la presente intervención se pretende mejorar el sistema de diagnóstico de tuberculosis disponible en Hospital de Bathalaplli. Este hospital pertenece a la organización local y atiende a la población rural más desfavorecida del distrito de Anantapur, que encuentra en él un centro accesible y asequible y con un servicio de calidad que ni el gobierno ni las clínicas privadas cubren para ellos.Se quiere poner en marcha un equipamiento de diagnóstico rápido y de mayor precisión. Esto supone la compra de un equipo MGIT BACTEC y de los reactivos necesarios así como la formación del personal de laboratorio implicado. Los resultados de determinados tipos de tuberculosis se podrán obtener en 10-14 días frente a las 4-6 semanas que se tarda actualmente. Además, serán en torno a un 20% más precisos. Se instalará en el laboratorio de microbiología de dicho hospital y permitirá hacer pruebas gratuitas a una media de 250 pacientes/mes. Un diagnóstico precoz contribuye a frenar la transmisión de la tuberculosis, ya que el paciente puede empezar con el tratamiento antes y deja menos espacio de tiempo en el que la enfermedad es contagiosa. El Programa Nacional Revisado para el Control de la Tuberculosis (Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program, RNTCP) del gobierno indio que sigue las recomendaciones de la OMS aconseja que los países con ingresos medios y bajos, como la India, refuercen sus capacidades de diagnóstico de tuberculosis con esta tecnología que ya se utiliza en el resto de países. El gobierno indio y RDT/WDT ya tienen experiencias colaboración en marcha para abordar la tuberculosis y se trabajará para que en un futuro próximo se pueda establecer un nuevo convenio de colaboración para el mantenimiento de este nuevo sistema de diagnóstico.","3","2014-07-04","2015-04-30",NA,NA,"CCAA CYL - Castilla y León","AC-27",NA,NA,"Spain",NA,"Government",10,"CCAA CYL - Castilla y León","AC-27",NA,NA,"Fundación Vicente Ferrer","AC-314",NA,NA,"IN","India","100","679","South Asia, regional",NA,"12263","Tuberculosis control","","","1",1,"110",10,"C01","5",NA,"EUR",28629,"28629","0","0",0,0,0

Si a la condición de Intocables sumamos la de alguna discapacidad, las personas sufren un alto nivel de marginación. En Navarra son 50.000 las personas con discapacidad, según la Coordinadora de Personas con Discapacidad Física de Navarra (ACODIFNA), sin duda, una cifra que evidencia la importante presencia y trascendencia que tienen en la sociedad, y cuán imprescindible es su reconocimiento y participación activa. OBJETIVO GENERAL Contribuir a un cambio en los valores, las actitudes y comportamientos de la ciudadanía de Pamplona-Iruñea encaminados a construir una sociedad global solidaria con las desigualdades Norte-Sur. Organizar el IV Ciclo sobre la India, con actividades diversas, este año, encaminado a dar a conocer la situación y los proyectos para las personas con discacidad de la India. Objetivo específico: Fomentar la implicación y el compromiso ciudadano en iniciativas solidarias a través de propuestas de sensibilización, formación y movilización acercando una realidad concreta de las personas con discapacidad de la India, desde un enfoque de género y derechos humanos. RESULTADOS El desarrollo y realización de propuestas de sensibilización y movilización dirigidas a la ciudadanía de Pamplona- Iruñea con la finalidad de promover la situación de discriminación que padecen las personas con discapacidad en la India. ACTIVIDADES - Exposición itinerante """"Descubre los derechos humanos con Likita"""" que será instalada en diversos centros de personas con discapacidad de Pamplona- Iruñea. - Mesa redonda ?Capacidades diferentes, iguales en derechos? con la participación de representantes de diversos colectivos y asociaciones de personas con discapacidad de Pamplona- Iruñea, para visibilizar sus propuestas e iniciativas. - Conferencia magistral de Sara Crespo, ex cooperante de la Fundación Vicente Ferrer, dirigida a sensibilizar a la ciudadanía en general sobre las capacidades diferentes.

POBLACIÓN PARTICIPANTE Público en general, familias de personas con discapacidad y Entidades que trabajan con personas con discapacidad; ASORNA, EUNATE, ONCE, CORMIN, ISTERRIA, ATENEA? VIABILIDAD DEL PROYECTO La Fundación Vicente Ferrer, trabaja en India desde 1969 y tiene el firme compromiso de continuar trabajando en valores con la ciudadanía, con su base social y voluntaria, con redes y organizaciones de la sociedad civil y centros educativos. Este Ciclo representa el IV Ciclo de la India en nuestra ciudad, cuyo objetivo de acercar la realidad de la India se hace desde una forma participativa a través de acciones y proyectos de sensibilización que tengan la finalidad de promover una transformación social más comprometida en la eliminación de las desigualdades Norte-Sur. ASPECTOS MÁS RELEVANTES DEL PROYECTO El trabajo de la FVF y las propuestas que desarrolla se articulan bajo un enfoque de derechos. Esto supone situar a las personas en el centro de toda iniciativa como sujetas activas y titulares de derechos. Desde la FVF se promueven procesos de empoderamiento para que las personas puedan exigir y reclamar sus derechos y participar de una vida democrática en igualdad de oportunidades. Aproximar la realidad local con la realidad de la India, tiene que ver con la sostenibilidad en el desarrollo, como factor fundamental que promueve el entendimiento y la comprensión de la realidad global y local, desde la toma de conciencia que la cultura, la política, la economía, de la diferencia y el medio ambiente, tienen relación e interdependencia en las relaciones humanas, independientemente de dónde se sitúen las personas.""","3","2014-08-01","2014-12-13",NA,NA,"EELL NAV - Navarra","AC-53",NA,NA,"Spain",NA,"Government",10,"EELL NAV AYTO PAMPLONA/IRUÑA","AC2-367",NA,NA,"Fundación Vicente Ferrer","AC-314",NA,NA,"IN","India","100","679","South Asia, regional",NA,"99820","Promotion of development awareness","","","1",1,"110",10,"H01","4",NA,"EUR",4230,"4230","0","0",0,0,0

Oxfam India is a strategic country for the Oxfam campaigns (specifically GROW), which means that to achieve the objectives of the campaigns it is crucial to work on a pro-poor stand of the Government and companies of India, as major donor, trade partner and investor in Low Income Countries, as well as major force in global governance (especially G20, BRICS, UNFCCC). For this reason Oxfam Novib is supporting India#s advocacy and campaigns capacity on two levels:
1) on implementing the GROW campaign in India,
2) on influencing India#s role in the World.

This support is part of the OI BRICSAM / G20 strategy which has as its main goal; increasing Oxfam global influencing capacity, by adjusting its campaigning resources to the changing power relations in the world. This means that the confederation has a commitment to provide additional resources to strengthen advocacy and campaigns capacity in emerging powers, specifically the BRICSAM countries. Oxfam Novib has created an #allocation fund BRICSAM countries# that willspecifically support the capacities in countries like Brazil, Mexico, China and India. Part of these resources is transferred to Oxfam Novib#s South Asia desk to support the work in India.

The first phase of this project was initiated in July 2011. The currentproject covers a second phase running from November 2012 until October 2012 and is part of a broader proposal that covers activities until October 2015. This proposal will also be supported from other sources, including OGB, OHK, the Gates/LEAP project (managed by Oxfam America).","2","2012-04-01","2014-03-31","2012-04-01","2014-03-31",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Oxfam India ","504505","Foundation",60,"IN","India",NA,NA,NA,NA,"4;1",";","10;90","Reporting Organisation (i.e. maintained by the organisation referred to in the <reporting-org> element.;Reporting Organisation (i.e. maintained by the organisation referred to in the <reporting-org> element.","RO;RO",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"EUR",NA,0,"617364","0","0",0,0,0

A total of 7683 houses have been burnt and razed to the ground because of the conflict.

Overall Objective of the response:
#  The overall objective of the program is to, #Contribute tothe improvement of public health  and prevention of Water Sanitation Related Diseases (WSRD) in the relief camps and ensure emergency shelter#.
# In order to achieve this goal, an intervention strategy is developed based on three key results linked to Water Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion accompanied with distribution of NFI including emergency shelter support to  27,000 conflict affected individuals in Kokrajhar and Chirang.

Specific outputs:
# Increased awareness of public health risks for 27000 ethnic conflict-affected people and support for them to make optimal use of WASH facilities and practice safe hygiene behaviours .
# 20 temporary bathing complex (4 units to a complex) would be constructed (this would mean that there would be 80 bathing units). They would be situated in locations where camps exist and where water supply is already established. Where water sources do not exist, Oxfam will install hand pumps so as to ensure that there is water source near the bathing cubicle. Design would include either bamboo or cement flooding with aggregate and drainage and soak pit for water management. The number of units would not conform to sphere, however, in certain locations the number of bathing cubicles might be less than what is required. This is because of space constraints. For security reasons construction of bathing cubicles would be as close to the camp or within the camp perimeter.
# Where there is space and camp is heavily populated and infrastructure exists # we would go for 5 twin units for 100 hh (550-600 persons) = 60 persons per cubicles. The number of people using it would be less because men generally use open spaces next to handpumps to bath.
# Target # womenand adolescent girls since they need privacy.
# 80 temporary latrines would be constructed to ensure that population living in theIDP camps have access to sanitation facilities. Majority of the camps have very unhygienic conditions and people defecate in the open spaces near the camp sites. In addition in locations such as schools the existing latrines are not sufficient to meet the demandsof the camp inmates and thus there is a need for temporary latrines.

This project covers the support for response work in Uttarakhand for a period of six months starting from June until December 2013.

With hundreds of people having lost their homes and belongings, the need for immediate shelter is crucial. Almost all flood-affected villages had poor sanitation facilities before the floods. Toilet coverage is extremely low. In many villages, it is mainly people of upper castes that construct latrines. Safe excreta disposal is, therefore, a necessity and is also a major challenge in almost all villages taking into account the way the villages are placed and the mountainous location of the village. Due to disruption of water sources people are drawing water from rivers in the village areas assessed. There is no Government distribution of water and there is a need for clean drinking water at thehousehold level.

With the monsoons still far from over in Uttarakhand rains pose a major threat to health and habitation in the flood affected area. Moreover in the next two months winter will set in and the displaced will need shelter protection during the harsh winter months. Immediate shelter support and the distribution of essential items such as non food items is also a very critical need for the many people who have had their homes washed away.

Oxfam India will implement the project in close coordination and partnership with Jan Vikas Sangatha (JVS) and Himalaya Parivartan Sangstha (HPSS) local partners of Oxfam India in Uttarakhand. The approach will be semi operational. Oxfam will implement and lead on all the key components of the programme. The local NGO partner - JVS and HPSS North would facilitate community mobilization, motivation and organisation, and field logistics support and distribution of relief material and assistance as part of the project support.

Project implementation and ways of working for both organizations will be established to ensure that Oxfam procedures, guidelines are strictly adhered to and complied. The response capacity of partners is moderate. Oxfam partners in Uttarakhand are not very experienced in humanitarian response. They have community mobilisation and motivation skills and network across the district, but in terms of technical programme requirement they would need Oxfam#s humanitarian staff support, which is now established.

The partner#s capacity on logistics, PHE, PHP, CFW and Cash transfer would be augmented by experienced Oxfam humanitarian staff who are deployed and based out of Uttarakhand. Oxfam India has one field base inGuptkashi and another one Uttarkashi.

Kalingapatnam, the adjacent district in the state of Andhra Pradesh was also affected by Cyclone Phailin.  Heavy rains brought by the cyclone Phailin that hit the coast on Saturday night led to flooding, causing a second crisis in Mayurbhanj, Balasore, Kendrapara, Bhadrak and Jajjpur district. The worst affected by flooding are the Balasore and Kendrapara district. Due to heavy precipitation, released water from the Hirakud dam has made the situation critical. Even as the life continued to remain out of gear in cyclone hit areas, the flood situation remained grim in 4 affected districts. There is full moon on 18th October; until then due to high tide the situation will remain worst. However, in Ganjam district, flood water has started receding since 16th October.

This Emergency Response is to provide immediate humanitarian assistance to decrease public health risks to 9750 cyclone-affected men women and children in Ganjam and Puri Districts through provision of water and sanitation facilities, public health services, emergency shelter and emergency food and livelihood assistance support by March 2013.

Disease outbreaks and non-sustainable production methods have heavily impacted the main Asian shrimp producing countries (specifically Thailand China and Vietnam) resulted in the arise of alternative production locations, such as India. Thanks to favourable geological and socio-economic conditions tropical shrimp production has developed rapidly in recent years in the State of Gujarat (Western-India). A group of approximately 500 (medium sized) shrimp farmers have joined forces in the Gujarat Aquaculture Farmers Association and together produce a significant volume of tropical shrimp (~21,000 tons in 2013). In the current situation the non-processed shrimps farmed in Gujarat are transported to the harbour of Mumbai (4-5h transport time), where they are sold at the auction. Pre-processing, processing, packaging and cooled storage of shrimp near the main production area would offer various advantages in terms of 
(a) quality improvement, 
(b) control of demand/supply fluctuations 
(c) product loss reduction and 
(d) costs savings.
 Mayank Aquaculture is one of the leading shrimp farmers in Gujarat. The company has the ambition (in cooperation with the Association) to invest in further vertically integrating its activities. These include setting up the pre-processing and processing plant handling part of the local volume produced. At the pre-processing and processing facility the shrimps will be washed peeled graded by size cooked and glazed. 
Secondly the company would like to invest in a packaging and cooled storage facility from where the final (frozen) products will be exported to international markets (mainly Europe).

In the next four years DDS aims at democratizing the debate on the GE crops/ foods by involving various stakeholders such as farmers, opinion leaders in the villages, panchayat leaders, students, consumers, legal experts and media so that they are in a better position to challenge the introduction of GE in South India. To achieve the objectives, DDS plans to exert its influence on the following areas:
a. Improving the understanding on Genetic Engineering (GE) among farmers, consumers, policy makers, academicians and civil society actors enhanced. This is expected to lead to rejection of GE consistently by at least 30% farmers among the focus groups by 2012.
b. Increased resistance by farmers, local bodies and consumers to GE. This would be reflected by at least 100 panchayats passing resolutions against GE, at least 500 farmers' clubs and SHGs ban the use of GE seeds by its members; legal actions would be initiated against GE seed companies in all south Indian states; media would allocate more time for GE debates
c. Policy support for greater regulation on GE and for ecological food and farming would be enhanced. This would be reflected by demands for stricter clauses from GEAC by state governments, existing regulatory clauses would be strictly enforced; policy in support of organic agriculture in all south Indian states would be announced.
d. Ecological options for food and farming would be further explored and promoted. This would lead to the emergence of 5000 organic farming groups under participatory guarantee systems by 2012; organic seeds farmers groups with 10,000 members are formed; increase in organic food outlets from 10 to 30 by 2012.

DDS' campaign objectives, its concerns regarding the threats faced by small and marginal farmers, and the issues that it raises regarding bio safety, are all very much in line with Hivos' own overall policy objectives, and particularly with its policy on sustainable production. The emphasis on working with majority of dalit women as its primary beneficiaries is also in line with the priorities of the sector.

In this phase SS will continue to strengthen institutions of MFP collectors with a view to sustain their livelihood base. The purpose of this project is to enhance access and control over livelihood resources of forest dependent communities in 5 districts and 10 blocks of Southern Rajasthan by 2013.

The activities would primarily seek to strengthen the existing cooperatives them at the state level, build their capacities for collecting, processing and marketing of 5 forest products. Samarthak Samiti and its members would also intensify their lobby with the government, on one hand to ensure that the community members have rights over the forest resources and also ensure that forest department takes measures for conservation of the resource base.

By the end of this phase SS would have promoted and strengthened 9 cooperatives with 70% of its members as women and 30% of the women would be in leadership positions. SS will reach out to 1600 marginalized families directly out of who 1000 are women, and 3000 families indirectly in approximately 70 villages of 10 blocks extending over 5 districts of Southern Rajasthan. Also one centralized processing centre would have been set up catering to the 9 cooperatives. Other activities include training, exposure visits, production of IEC materials, linkages with traders and forest department, propagation of saplings, providing business development services, networking and organizing pressure groups.

Its advocacy efforts would specifically address issues related to the forest dependent communities in the Forest Act, Panchayati Raj Extension in Scheduled areas (PESA) act, Tribal Self Rule (TSR), transit permit, tendering process and it would also sensitise the panchayat members related to these issues.

It is expected that by the end of the phase SS would have established 9 vibrant cooperatives with strong membership and leadership of women that would be functioning autonomously. The empowerment process should also enable the cooperatives to strengthen their bargaining power with various arms of the state and also participate in the local markets from a position of strength.
SS' goals and strategies to strengthen the MFP based livelihoods of tribal women are in congruence with HIVOS' policy on sustainable production.

Gene Campaign, has on the basis of its experience of working in Jharkhand and after discussions with its stakeholders, decided on the primary objectrive of piloting community-based production of high quality seed. This it feels will help local farmers cope with the acute shortage of seeds and Gene Campaign hopes that this model will prove successful for upscaling by the state. It envisages that seed producing farmers groups will be organised into seed producing cooperatives leading up to the establishment of a Producer Group Company in the long-term. The other objectives of the project are the provision of weather advisories to farmers, conservation of crop genetic biodiversity by setting up an additonal two community gene seed banks, making crop production sustainable and high yielding via field research on System of Rice Intensification [SRI] and improving local soil health, and lobby and advocacy for as part of the Revitalising Rainfed Agriculture network.

Some of the expected results are:
- 600 farm families from 55 villages take part in seed production
- 550 metric tonnes of disease-resistant rice seed and 160 metric tonnes of aromatic rice seed produced by the third year of the project
- 70 metric tonnes of horse gram produced by the third year of the project
- Scientific data gathered on the performance of SRI under different field conditions
- Improvements in soil health in working area
- Evidence of gradual shift in subsidies for bio-organic cultivation, especially in rain-fed areas
- Increase in the government's policy focus on decentralised seed production.

Gene Campaign's objectives and plans as part of this project fit well with the policy priorities regarding sustainable agriculture of both Hivos and the Ford Foundation, with whom the Hivos Regional Office has established the Ford Foundation-Hivos Fund for Sustainable Rainfed Agriculture. Hence, Gene Campaign will be supported via the joint fund.

The thrust of DISHA’s work in the three-year project is to engage in mobilisation and collectivisation of tribals for lobby/advocacy and monitoring towards making government institutions more accountable, specifically  with regard to forest land entitlements, job guarantees, and the rights and entitlements of unorganised sector workers. DISHA will also continue to build and strengthen its partner people’s organisations [the tribal organisation Eklavya Sangathan and 69 CBOS, including the Atarsumba Women’s CBO] and trade unions [Agricultural Labourers Union, Forest Workers Union, Construction Workers Union, Mine Workers Union, NREGA Workers Union and the all-women Tendu Leaf Pluckers Union] by providing technical assistance, financial support, legal aid, capacity building support and infrastructure. 
DISHA’s planned activities for the project are: campaigns and social mobilisation for effective implementation of laws and policies; monitoring meetings to track progress, capacity building training programmes for executive members of trade unions and staff; legal support; providing honorariums to 7 community workers; advocacy and lobby with government institutions; research and documentation; and organising bi-annual executive committee meetings of the 6 trade unions. DISHA is expected to have a direct outreach of approximately 84,000 individuals, all of whom are members of its partner people’s organisations and trade unions. 
The envisaged outputs and linked indicators for DISHA’s activities are: 

Objective 1: Promotion of Forest Land rights and entitlements
657 community claims for forest land submitted; 10,000 farmers receive forest land record books each year; increase in the number of individual claims accepted each year; number of cases filed for denial for forest land rights and number of cases redressed successfully; number of women with joint-ownership of granted land titles; 90% of eligible scheduled tribe families have applied for forest land. 

Objective 2: Job guarantee under NREGA
At least 1,800 households receive 100 days’ employment from NREGA and 4,500 households receive NREGA job cards each year; number of women receiving 100 days’ employment each year; increase in the number of households receiving 100 days’ employment and job cards every year; follow-up made against violation of NREGA provisions; supervision and monitoring of work sites by mandal members; functional operational structure of the NREGA Workers Union at the taluk-level. 

Objective 3: Access to rights and entitlements by unorganised workers
Effective mobilisation by the 6 trade unions, Eklavya Sangathan, the Atarsumba Women’s CBO, and the Land Rights Protection Committee to advance the rights of unorganised workers; follow-up made on violations of legal provisions for and/or exploitation of unorganised workers; number of women and men receiving the revised minimum wage for agricultural labourers each year; institutional development and increase in membership of the trade unions, Eklavya Sangathan and the Atarsumba Women’s CBO. 

DISHA is a key partner of UUHHJIF and will make contributions to Result Area 1 and 3 of Hivos’ Rights and Citizenship Program -   excluded and marginalised citizens claim space for participation and full citizenship; llegislation and policy meet international standards and are implemented in a manner that benefits all citizens and reduces existing inequalities.

The primary focus of this phase (2011-15) would be on the following broad objectives - Establishing integrated farming system models which are ecologically and economically sustainable; Building farmers' cooperatives which improve farmers' access to markets; Building capacities of farmers, agricultural workers and civil society workers for promotion of sustainable agriculture; Lobbying and campaigning for a better and supportive policy environment for sustainable agriculture. The main beneficiaries are small and marginal farmers, of which majority are backward communities, dalits, schedule tribes and particularly resource poor and women farmers. CSA (and its partner organizations) is expected to reach out to 5,000 farmers directly through farmers cooperatives. Most of these (except 5 villages) have been covered under the previous phase under NPM, now the emphasis is on adopting organic practices in addition to NPM, and linking them with markets. The analytical approach to be adopted for the next phase would be on a ‘value chain approach’, i.e., developing backward and forward linkages to the sustainable production systems. 

In the last phase, CSA partnered with nine organizations to demonstrate alternatives at the ground level and to organize farmers into cooperatives. In the present phase, consolidation of previous efforts would be concentrated in three locations (two districts each) in the state of Andhra Pradesh.  Three of CSA's partners – CROPS (Jangaon, Warangal district), PEACE (Bhongir, Nalgonda dist), REDS (Ananthpur dist) will continue and in Kurnool, Vijayanagaram and Vishakapatnam districts CSA will directly work with community-based organizations. The other four cooperatives established during the last phase continue to be in the Federation and technical support would be extended to them. In this phase, the focus will be on building a federation of these cooperatives and on mobilizing resources from government programs and banks. The project outcomes/effects are envisaged as follows -  farmers move into local-resource-based sustainable agriculture; productivity is increased because quality seed is available in a timely way at field level through community seed banks (10 crops per seed bank); farmers' incomes increase due to adoption of ecological practices, crop diversification and horticulture; food and nutritional security enhanced; community and state-level institutions are formed for improving marketing and policy advocacy; pro-farmer, pro-sustainable agriculture government policies are made. 

The various activities planned are necessary to achieve the results of an ecologically sound, socially relevant and economically promising agriculture.  Sustainable agriculture provides an alternative to chemical farming and also empowers the farmers to use their practice-based knowledge for advocacy work and network building for greater impact.

With the objective of providing sustainable livelihoods and incomes to women belonging to SHGs and helping them to secure allied job opportunities in services and other sectors, SSP founded Sakhi Retail as a revenue model. The primary goal of Sakhi Retail is to create and scale-up outreach through distribution networks led by grassroots women while building the rural entrepreneurship ecosystem. As of now, Sakhi Retail is operational in Solapur and Osmanabad district of Maharashtra, selling a range of Renewable Energy,agriculture, and health and environment friendly products. 

In the current project, SSP aims to create “Clean and Green Aware Communities” through developing a network of technology providers and a women-led distribution chain which will design and implement effective communication strategies on renewable energy. 

The project focuses on identifying village-level women entrepreneurs (Sakhis) and developing their business and marketing skills in order to educate and assist rural communities to gain access to low-cost energy products. The project will also assist SSP and Sakhi retail to act as product incubator for innovative solutions in biofuel and solar energy sectors using previous experience of co-development of products and grassroots business models, such as smokeless cookstove and low-energy mini fridge. 

The project is expected to benefit the lives of 29,000+ rural households by supplying quality and affordable renewable energy products through an established network of 250 Sakhis in Latur and Beed districts of Maharashtra.The number of households and Sakhis is expected to rise based on the result of awareness created. In addition, SSP will document and share the process, strategies and results as project learning. 

The project's overall objective of assisting rural communities to gain access to clean and low cost energy products through women-led distribution networks fits well into the result area-2 of Hivos' Green Entrepreneurship(GE) programme.  Consequently,supporting the innovation will be Hivos' first step towards expanding its engagement with renewable energy initiatives in India under the GE programme.

In this three-year (2011-14) phase, DF would be largely working in tribal areas to strengthen people's institutions promoted during the last phase and will evolve a model for integration of microfinance with livelihoods. DF will continue to work in five tribal locations of Mayurbhanj district of Orissa and Latehar district of Jharkhand.  In addition, DF will engage in green entrepreneurship activities in specified locations in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. The main activities are - Organising tribal women into SHGs (with bank linkage) and forming federations (Saturating Locations, Development of SHGs, Capacity Building of SHG Members and Leaders, Cluster Promotion and Federation Promotion and Development); promoting green entrepreneurship (promoting activity-based livelihoods viz., red gram procurement, value addition and marketing, soya bean collective marketing, cashew nut processing and marketing, promoting urban agriculture); agricultural development programme in tribal areas (focused on kharif rice stabilisation to ensure year-round food security through improved cultivation practices along with promotion of critical irrigation support like SRI); inland fisheries programme in Tribal locations; institutional developmental processes of DF (Consultative Forum Meetings, annual retreats and organising state-level workshops and seminars) and policy advocacy for tribal welfare.

The expected outcomes by the end of project period are: 
a) Emergence of community-owned and managed SHGs (with bank linkages) and related network institutions such as cluster development associations and federations in tribal areas of Mayurbhanj district, Orissa and Latehar district, Jharkhand. 
b) 15,000 tribal women are organised into 1,100 SHGs and these SHGs have graduated into 40 cluster development associations in 5 federations.
c) A model for integrating SHGs and activity-based green entrepreneurship interventions is evolved and the livelihoods status of SHG members is enhanced.
d) 3,000 households in rural, coastal and urban locations benefit from the promotion of agriculture-based livelihood interventions. 
e) Productivity and income from agriculture is enhanced for 500 tribal families by upgrading their skills and building linkages through agricultural interventions in two project locations. 
f) The supplementary income of 1000 tribal families is increased by promoting freshwater fish rearing (30 new ponds and 20 existing ponds).
g) The institutional developmental processes of DHAN Foundation are strengthened and policy advocacy efforts for tribal welfare are undertaken.

In total, 20,000 households will be reached during the project period. Most of these households belong to the very poor and are located in remote tribal areas where financial inclusion is minimal. Hence, DHAN Foundation's model of microfinance coupled with livelihood development is imperative for community development in the context, and hence the project qualifies strongly for Hivos' support.","2",NA,NA,"2011-04-01","2014-03-31",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Dhan Foundation",NA,NA,NA,"IN","India",NA,NA,NA,NA,"313;311;240",";;","13;17;70","OECD Development Assistance Committee 3 digit codes;OECD Development Assistance Committee 3 digit codes;OECD Development Assistance Committee 3 digit codes","DAC-3;DAC-3;DAC-3",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"EUR","EUR",0,"603050","0","0",0,0,0

In the past years, JCS achieved notable success in strengthening microfinance activities in rural areas of south Rajasthan by forming a tribal savings and credit co-operative society (ABESSSL), and expanding its outreach and portfolio. Subsequently, in light of challenges faced by the rural community, JCS has endeavored to improve livelihood systems. Improvement in crop cultivation techniques, forest-based livelihood interventions and livestock development to further diversify livelihood options are urgently needed to improve the economic status of the community. Rapid agricultural growth complemented by non-farm sector initiatives in rain-fed and semi-arid areas hold the key to poverty reduction.

During 2011-2013, JCS will provide institutional development support to ABESSSL in order to improve its credit plus services and its ability to provide entrepreneurship skill development training to its clients. Institutional development support comprises of systems and process development including audit, HR and Monitoring & Evaluation, capacity building of staff, designing credit products and financial policy, computerization of MIS and streamlining  operation and delinquency management to make the organization self reliant.

In association with National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) and Rajasthan Mission on Skill and Livelihoods (RMOL), JCS will provide entrepreneurship skill development encompassing training on turmeric production, dairy, goat rearing, NTFP collection / process / marketing, petty shops, cycle repair and other opportunities.

The project is expected to improve the livelihood of 10,000 poor tribal households through providing financial and livelihood assistance and social security benefits by the end of two years in Sirohi district of South Rajasthan. Capacity building of grassroots organizations such that they can contribute to financial inclusion is a key aspect of Hivos’ Green Entrepreneurship programme. Hence, the project fits well into the framework of Hivos’ Green Entrepreneurship programme.

During 2011-13, SMS will work towards the following goals: a. promotion of cooperatives; b. training and capacity building of the farmers and cooperatives; c. promotion of marketing activities; d. improvement in agricultural yields using sustainable agricultural practices. 6100 farmers will be reached in largely interior villages of Anantapur and Adilabad districts of Andhra Pradesh.

The main objectives to be achieved are to create well-run cooperatives that substantially raise farmer incomes, allow them to save, improve yields, bring in better farm practices, move up the value chain in marketing. The goal is financial independence of small farmer families along with adoption of more sustainable farming practices. SMS' philosophy is to enable cooperatives to eventually manage their own business operations.  SMS intends to create a model that is substantial in scale, can replicated, and can influence policy. The increase in farmers' incomes will be achieved mainly through setting up of processing units - for groundnuts in Anantapur and cotton in Adilabad.  SMS plans to help farmers to move up the value chain where possible. 

SMS will establish cooperatives, enable them to engage sustainable agriculture, improve yield and scale them up.  SMS will set up systems that will enable them to market their produce. SMS will also extend business development support. SMS will continuously study the markets for the three commodities it works with - soyabean, groundnut (or peanut) and pulses (toor dal). In addition, SMS will tie up with various financial institutions for working capital on behalf of the cooperatives. SMS will also raises investments for the processing units, two of which have already been set up. SMS will also help farmer organization federations to negotiate and enter into agreements for input purchases. 
 
SMS' enterprise development model through farmers' cooperatives and adoption of sustainable agricultural practices is congruent with Hivos' Green Entrepreneurship programme.

IDF has developed a unique four-tier structure for organising small producers.  The foundation of the structure is village-level Self-Help Groups (SHGs).  The subsequent tiers are at the cluster level, village panchayat (unit of self-government), and district levels.  The district-level apex community-based organisations (CBOs) have been registered as mutually aided societies. Eight such apex CBOs have a membership of 0.2 million poor households across 11 districts of Karnataka. 

Between 2011-2014, IDF will work to strengthen these CBOs of the poor community through various institutional development processes so that they become autonomous, self sustaining, and self propagating and are able to help the poor come out of poverty through various services facilitated by Civil Society Organisations. The CBOs are also expected to contribute to the robustness of grassroots democracy and the effectiveness of governmental, bank and corporate, civil society organisations. 

The primary objective is institutional development of the present and evolving CBOs promoted by IDF.  It is expected that there will be an improvement in self-governance and in local leadership.  One of the consequences of such strengthening would be promotion of self-help and entrepreneurial culture among the poor and enhancement of financial inclusion and generation of sustainable livelihoods.  It is expected that standard process documents and communication tools for replication of institutional development of CBOs would also be produced.

By 2014, it is anticipated that  the CBOs would have achieved at all levels (a) Well-developed shared vision and core competencies of the governance team; (b) Sound financial and accounting systems; (c) Well-developed skills in mobilizing financial resources, and ability ot seize livelihood opportunities and link with policy makers and markets; (d) Knowledge regarding CBO institution building in terms of best practices and process documentation.

IDF's objectives and approach are in line with the Green Entrepreneurship program of Hivos.

In this project period, CSD will take initial steps towards devising and building strategies for the protection of the civil and political rights of adivasi [tribal] communities in India. 

To further this agenda, CSD has visualised a three-stage process in the long term, with the first stage being the development of legal practice guides for lawyers and human rights activists for issues pertaining to the civil rights of tribal communities. These practice guides will include legal procedures and strategies used in actual cases, and CSD will undertake research to map successful strategies and the range and types of litigation available for the protection of the human rights of tribals. In addition, research towards strategic litigation [Public Interest Litigations, petitions etc] will be undertaken via Public Interest Litigations or by petitioning local, statutory or constitutional authorities.  In the second stage, CSD will identify and train activists and lawyers in selected districts and states on using the practice guides, and prepare a curriculum for this process. In the final stage, it is envisaged that units of trained paralegals will be formed in selected states, which will investigate, monitor and draft cases pertaining to adivasi rights, and which will draw on established lawyers to argue cases.

In 2011-12, CSD, with UUHHJIF support, will undertake the following activities:
-	Case research 
-	Research for strategic litigation
-	3 fellowships [of 4 to 12 weeks each] to researchers 
-	Meetings with researchers to discuss cases, the status of adivasi rights, and the methodology for case research, archiving and documentation. 
-	Development of legal practice guides
-	Testing of practice guide modules
-	3 [15 days each] legal clinics for senior undergraduate law students from selected states on the civil and political rights of adivasis, with 25 students per clinic
-	4 training programmes for community activists from Andhra Pradesh to equip them to be paralegal workers. 30 participants are expected in each training.

The main expected or anticipated results are:
-	Development of legal practice guides on adivasi rights;  
-	Through use of the legal practice guides lawyers and activists are able to intervene more effectively; 
-	Strategic legal interventions are undertaken; 
-	Researcg knowledge outputs are prepared;
-	The understanding of undergraduate law students of civil and political rights of adivasis  is enhanced;
-	Community activists from Andhra Pradesh are trained to function as paralegal workers.

CSD is expected to make important contributions to Result Area 1 of Hivos’ Rights and Citizenship Programme: “Excluded and marginalised citizens claim space for participation and full citizenship.”

Vasundhara endeavours to work for Community forestry with explicit focus on the sustainable livelihood of the marginalised sections and on different environmental and biodiversity conservation issues.  Vasundhara's initiatives aim to create an enabling environment that will help rural and tribal population (especially women) to come out of the poverty trap by increasing the scope of forest-based livelihoods in the state of Odisha. 

Vasundhara works on sustainable livelihood issues by facilitating development of community enterprises  in the form of self-reliant cooperatives based on Non-Timber Forest Produce (NTFP). In addition, it contributes to environmental conservation by supporting and strengthening community-based initiatives to protect and conserve forests in Odisha.

Vasundhara's work helped to make NTFP-based livelihoods a central element in several rural and tribal development interventions in Odisha and led to the NTFP Policy of 2000 that eventually gave rights to more than 67 NTFP items to Gram Sabhas (Village Assembly). Vasundhara's interventions on livelihoods have led to the formation of 27 primary cooperatives and 2 unions trading in NTFPs covering around 1850 households in 30 Gram Panchayats (Village Councils jurisdiction) of four districts.  This resulted in a rise in income for an estimated 6000 indirect beneficiaries from commodities traded through the cooperatives . Women form the membership of the primary cooperatives, and 80% belong to scheduled tribes. 

The cooperatives and unions are engaged in collective trade of various NTFPs (e.g., Mohua, Siali leaves, Sal seed) and are creating a variety of value-added products. The cooperatives practice an advance-based commodity pooling model of business and sales are coordinated and facilitated by the unions at a nominal service charge. The goal of Vasundhara is to assist communities to gain access and control over the use of forest resources, thereby contributing towards sustainable livelihoods of the poor and to a greater economic decentralisation.

Vasundhara was formed in 1991 to work for institutional and policy changes in community forest management in the state of Odisha. It was registered under the Societies Registration Act in 1992.  Initially the work was focused on research , policy advocacy and networking. After 2000, with Hivos’ support, Vasundhara's work became more diversified towards sustainable forest based livelihood.  During 2012-2015 Vasundhara will support the women's cooperatives and unions to become economically independent and self–reliant in terms of their decision-making ability. 

By 2015, it is anticipated that these unions including primary cooperatives will have clear and comprehensive business plans. The income of cooperative members will increase with newer livelihood areas being integrated. Two retail outlets will be opened at union level which will be run and managed by their members. Members of the cooperatives will be able to negotiate with government for better infrastructure facilities (rural godowns) for the NTFP business.

Vasundhara's objectives are congruent with Hivos's policies: on access to resources (land, water, agriculture & forests) for marginalised forest communities and promotion of community enterprise for economic empowerment. Vasundhara's objectives of strengthening community participation and developing of networks of tribal and women's organisations and promotion of community based enterprises, are central to Hivos' policy concerns.

WASSAN promotes initiatives inspired by community based natural resource management approaches, and focuses on mainstreaming these initiatives. This ensures scale and sustainability of these initiatives. Community based organisations (CBO) are at the heart of all  initiatives; CBO membership has been primarily of women. 

While several CSOs have been working on related issues of management of natural resources, very few have been able to use 'models' to embed them within state policies and programmes.  WASSAN is also one of the few organisations that has been able to work on an integrated systems approach where work on several themes like seeds, water, livestock, crops, soils etc is layered in a common geography.  Its work has gained WASSAN significant recognition at policy levels at the state and national levels. 

WASSAN would be the role model for the implementation of the comprehensive pilots which other CSOs across the country would try to emulate. The comprehensive pilots are key to demonstrating how the public investment regime needs to be structured to achieve higher agricultural productivity gains in rainfed areas.  

WASSAN intends to implement a comprehensive pilot in Daulatabad mandal of Andhra Pradesh. It aims to integrate aspects of seed systems, water management, livestock, inland fisheries, institutions etc into the government programmes and schemes. The uptake of the evidence related to productivity gains and increased food security will be directly into the State policy and programmes.     

As a secretariat of the Revitalising Rainfed Agriculture Network, WASSAN commands substantial respect from CSOs, academia and State alike. Its inclusive approach and strong value system has enabled the growth of the network. 

There is good resonance between the goals of WASSAN with that of Hivos.  Also, congruence in terms of values make WASSAN a natural ally.

During 2012-2015 with Hivos’ support Ninasam will focus on building the capacities of the board members, grooming second line leadership and improving their Information and Communication Technology (ICT) skills. Additionally the cultural conference and summer theatre workshop will also be supported. 

Ninasam, a registered society, was founded in 1949 by theatre practitioners.  Ninasam’s work has brought many honours, including the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Creative Arts, Communication and Journalism, which was conferred on its co-founder K.V. Subbanna.

Hivos values Ninasam for its ability to bring high quality theatre production to the rural audiences. Also, Ninasam has been able to build a bridge between rural cultural spaces and larger national and international theatre discourse. Ninasam is also part of the India Theatre Forum, a budding forum of theatre groups, which aims to represent and respond to the interests and concerns of Indian theatre groups.

Considering Ninasam has created and promoted spaces for cultural expression of the rural masses it finds high synergy with the framework of the Expression and Engagement programme in Hivos

Over the last two decades, Samaj Pragati Sahayog (SPS) has grown to be one of India's largest grass-roots initiatives for water and livelihood security in around 260 villages of Dewas district of Madhya Pradesh, mainly in the  Adivasi (tribal) belt. This work has enhanced drinking water availability and has sustained employment generation and livelihood security in intervened villages.

SPS believes that location-specific watershed development combined with low-cost, low-risk agriculture, other nature-based livelihoods and women-led microfinance, can dramatically raise rural incomes, providing an enduring panacea to farmers in India's drylands.  SPS has worked out a package of agricultural practices finely tuned to the locally available natural resources and, thus, accessible to the poor (low-cost) and sustainable (low-risk). This approach arrests distress migration and liberates the rural poor from the clutches of usurious moneylender-traders. The central mandate of SPS is to empower India's most disadvantaged people - women, Adivasis, Dalits and the poor - thereby contributing to the strengthening of democracy at the grass-roots.  SPS also focuses on building and strengthening women-led people’s institutions which support participatory and decentralised governance.  Besides, SPS has worked closely with the government in programmes like MGNREGS (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme) to ensure effective expenditure leading to increase in irrigation and creation of sustainable livelihoods.

SPS is a society registered in 1990 under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 and headquartered in Bagli block of Devas District of Madhya Pradesh.  SPS is also a member of Revitalizing Rainfed  Agriculture  (RRA)  Network which  has  109 members spread across rainfed areas of the country, and is emerging as an important platform articulating the issues of rainfed agriculture at the national level.

SPS intends to implement a comprehensive pilot to revitalise rainfed agriculture in 200 villages in and around Bagli block of Dewas District, Madhya Pradesh.  Though this pilot, SPS proposes to formulate the framework and elements of a comprehensive package of rainfed area interventions. 

The programme objectives are in congruence with the goal of revitalising rainfed agriculture, which is a key element of Hivos' Green Enterpreneurship Programme in India.

The Aga Khan Rural Support Programme (India) works as a catalyst for the betterment of rural communities by providing direct support to local communities for activities and to develop models for sustainable use of natural resource and development of human resources. 
After 25 years of committed involvement in the development sector, AKRSP (India) today is working in over 1500 villages in three states of India namely Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Bihar.  AKRSP has been working in over 1100 villages in four environmentally challenged and economically vulnerable regions of Gujarat: the tribal blocks of Bharuch, Narmada, Surat & Tapi districts, coastal salinity-affected Junagadh & Porbandar districts and the drought-prone Surendranagar district. 

AKRSP has innovated and pioneered several initiatives in different thematic areas such as participatory irrigation management, joint forest management, rain water harvesting, watershed development, salinity ingress prevention and alternative energy to improve the quality of land, increase the availability of water for irrigation and introduce new inputs or technologies that improve agricultural productivity and to empower rural women and marginalized communities. Its work in these areas has helped to improve food security, increase agricultural income and reduce risks for the landed farmers and provide livelihood options for the poor and landless farmers. Focusing on landless farmers, families with small holdings and farmers with three acres or less, it has introduced a range of options from systems to improve rice and wheat yields to small-scale vegetable farming and other alternative means of livelihood.

AKRSP was selected as Project Implementation Agency for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) in Madhya Pradesh, which ensures that employment generation schemes lead to productive assets. Distress migration has been reduced by 70-90 percent among farmers and by 30-50 percent among agricultural labourers, according to a research study carried out by the International Water Management Institute titled “Agrarian Transformation Among Tribals: From Migrants to Farmer Irrigators”. AKRSP was the first NGO to implement Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) in Gujarat. Today, there is a PIM Act in Gujarat. AKRSP’s watershed approach has been recognised by Government through a citation of AKRSP in the revised national watershed guidelines.
AKRSP (India) is the part of Global Aga Khan Development Foundation eshtablished by His Highness the Aga Khan in 1984. It began its field operations in 1985 and has since become one of the largest grassroots NGOs in India with more than 250 staff in 27 locations and an annual budget of $6 million. It is also a member of Revitalizing Rainfed  Agriculture  (RRA)  Network which  has  109 members spread across rainfed areas of the country, and is emerging as an important platform for articulating the issues of rainfed agriculture at the national level.

AKRSP will implement a comprehensive pilot project on rainfed agriculture, which aims to  improve rural livelihoods and food security in four districts (Khandwa, Burhanpur, Khargone and Barwani)of Nimar region of Madhya Pradesh.  AKRSP has conceptualized a comprehensive model of rainfed agriculture, which would improve rural income through increased local employment opportunities, and have an impact on rural governance.  AKRSP will share its experience of implementing this model in larger domain.  

The programme objectives are in congruence with the goal of revitalising rainfed agriculture, which is a key element of Hivos' Green Enterpreneurship Programme in India.

Rashtriya Grameen Vikas Nidhi (RGVN) is a national-level development support organization that provides financial, technical and management  support to civil society organisations in fourteen Eastern and Northeastern Indian states .This support has strengthened 2700 civil society organizations benefiting nearly 1,50,682 households through more than 10,000 Self Help Groups (SHGs) formation. These networks of civil society organisations and SHGs are RGVN’s strength; many of them are now capable of taking up larger development projects. 

RGVN was founded as an autonomous, non profit organization in 1990. Since its inception, RGVN has worked relentlessly to explore and support sustainable  livelihoods,  promote  individual  and  community  initiatives  and build local capabilities. With the demand from the field and changes in the external world, RGVN also initiated microfinance (MF) retail programme in 1995.  RGVN’s MF activities  have now taken the form of an independent legal entity called the Brahmaputra Community Development Trust. Separation  of  MF  activities  has  given  RGVN  a  new  direction  to  focus  on  livelihood  sub-sectors  and  livelihood  enhancement  projects.  RGVN is now focusing on developing certain potential livelihood sub-sectors across various regions within RGVN’s operational area.   RGVN  has received an Award for “Outstanding Financial Inclusion Project in Northeastern Region” from the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) in 2010. 

In Orissa and Andhra Pradesh, RGVN has enabled promotion of more than 350 grassroots organisations and reached out mostly through women to nearly 92,000 households through its  main programmes like  NGO Support Programme (NGOSP) and  Credit and Savings Programme (NGOMF).  

Next phase of Hivos support to RGVN focuses on empowering women in agriculture, NTFP and Handicraft through by organizing them into Producer Groups and making systematic interventions to enhance their participation and productivity in order to improve their Household income and food security. The project aims towards organizing 3650 women  from tribal dominated pockets of South & west Odisha , Telengana & north Andhra Pradesh into Eight Producers’ groups (Six Organic Vegetable  growers organization, One NTFP Producers  Group and One handicraft artisan based Producers Organization) 

RGVN's multi- dimensional approach to reduce poverty through socio-economic empowerment of the poor fits well with the policy focus of HIVOS' Green Entrepreneurship Programme.

Building and Enabling Disaster Resilience Of Coastal Communities (BEDROC), formerly the NGO Coordination and Resource Centre (NCRC), has been active in Nagapattinam since the Tsunami of 2004. While initially it was involved in facilitating equitable and sustainable post-disaster rehabilitation efforts, by 2007 it was registered as a formal agency for building up long tern resilience of the vulnerable coastal communities. Understanding that resilience could only be built up through inclusive development, BEDROC focused on building the resilience of the farming communities by strengthening traditional livelihoods. This is done through Better Water Resource Management, Improved Farm & Crop Management, Collectivization and Institution Development. Through the project, 'Accelerating Inclusive Development Through Building and Strengthening Producer Collectives (2012 - 2014)', Hivos supports BEDROC to a. Promote inclusive development through agriculture; b. Build capacity and develop community-based institutions; c. Develop systems for value chain management; and d. Build, stabilize and strengthen remunerative markets

Through this project, BEDROC will include the generally excluded. BEDROC will work with women, landless and dalit agricultural labourers and support them for cultivation of horticultural crops, small millets, fodder, etc during income stressed periods. Women in certain areas will be encouraged to take up homestead cultivation. They will be encouraged to register as members in existing Water User Associations (WUA) or will be encouraged to form a Farmers’ Association. In addition, BEDROC will promote sustainable agriculture through a comprehensive package of practices starting from increasing soil fertility to water management, supply of quality seeds, improved on-farm practices and better crop management. BEDROC will be work closely with reputed organizations like CIKS, Krishi Vigyan Kendra, etc for transfer of knowledge, capacity building and for supply of inputs. 

BEDROC worked strongly in building the capacities of local communities for sustainable operation and maintenance of their resources, and 27 village level WUAs were formed. Given the fact that all the stakeholders in the Water User Associations (WUAs) are farmers, these platforms built up were seen to have an advantage that went beyond just water resource management. There are 1063 farmer members in these WUAs, of which, 84% are small and marginal farmers. With a view to leveraging their improved economies of scale through collectivization, a separate institution dedicated to marketing aspects was set up and registered as the Nagai Agri Producers’ Company (NAPROC). All commercial activities are activated through this Company. BEDROC will work towards building up people’s institutions by instilling sense of ownership, building up the capacities of the members and developing local leadership so that these organizations manage their operations on their own. The members of the producer organization will be capacitated to understand marketing as a collective effort apart from mandatory requirements associated with running a legal commercial enterprise like taxation, audits, quality control aspects etc, so as to make the producer organization sustainable. BEDROC will facilitate market linkages with retail chains and neighboring markets to sell agri produce through NAPROC. Women homestead cultivators, landless and dalit labourers will be encouraged to take up contract farming on fallow lands after understanding the market needs. 

As a part of the dairying activities, 10 milk collectives have been set up and these Milk Collectives have been federated under the Nagai Milk Producers’ Company (NAMPCO). There are plans to increase this to 50 milk collectives in the next three years. The transaction levels will be very high and the record keeping will become difficult and labour intensive unless the transactions are computerized on a daily basis. BEDROC will use customized computerised MIS for streamlined business operations.

The project will reach out to 1000 small holder farmers approximately. About 700 farmers will be benefited through provision of inputs like certified seeds, 200 agricultural labourers/ assetless families be will be supported in augmenting their income through horticulture and  relay cropping. Apart from this, the project will also be involving 100 women directly through horticulture and homestead farming and 100 farmers benefit from development of remunerative markets. The project also benefits around 3000 milk producers indirectly.

BEDROC will work in rainfed areas and will help smallholder producer companies to become sustainable. It will promote sustainable agricultural practices and build the livelihood options of women and marginalized communities. All of these are the priority areas of the the Green Entrepreneurship programme of Hivos.

Centre for Indian Knowledge Systems (CIKS) has been working with a vision of utilization of indigenous knowledge and resources for sustainable growth and agriculture since the last eighteen years and has significantly demonstrated the viability of several sustainable agricultural practices. It has currently reached a stage where several of the research outcomes, field engagements and models are ready for upscaling and mainstreaming. Through this project, ""Towards Mainstreaming and Upscaling Sustainable Agriculture in Tamil Nadu (2012-2015)"" Hivos supports CIKS to position itself as a flagship organization and work towards being a national centre for sustainable agriculture to ensure food and nutrition security while sustaining and enriching the natural resource base through knowledge, scalable models and creating an enabling environment. This project has three components, namely, A. Poverty reduction through sustainable agriculture in Tamil Nadu; B. Development of human resources for sustainable organic farming; and C. Up-scaling technologies through convergence. 

'Poverty reduction through sustainable agriculture in Tamil Nadu' (co-funded by DFID) aims to enhance incomes of 9000 small holder agricultural households in three districts of Tamil Nadu (1400 landless, 5400 marginal and small and 2200 medium farmers from 75 villages in the districts of Kancheepuram, Tiruvannamalai and Nagapattinam) in an accelerated and sustainable way. Emphasis is on farming that uses locally generated inputs and resources to assure farmers get better returns for their produce and ensure their livelihood security. Based on this understanding, the strategy is to have a four pronged approach - increase production, decrease cultivation cost, improve credit and improve markets. There are seven direct interventions viz. 1) Home Gardens, 2) Full package of practices, including organic practices, 3) Provision of quality seeds and fertility improvement products, 4) Provision of Bio-pesticides, 5) Market information and linkages 6) Value addition, 7) Allied activities like backyard poultry. CIKS' experience shows that quality inputs and services related to these seven interventions can substantially make agriculture remunerative for the small holders. The delivery model for carrying out these interventions will include farmers’ sangams at the village level and farmers federation (agriculture producer company) at the district level. Agriculture services will be provided by Village Agricultural Business Development Services Providers (lead farmers) and they will ensure delivery of local and household-specific critical information on proven technologies and practices. This will be a farmer-led social enterprise model with the potential to sustain itself, and to upscale for larger impact.

'Development of human resources for sustainable organic farming' is seen as an important need. While many civil society organizations are involved in promoting sustainable agriculture, a major lacuna is human resources in the sector, as technical personnel in the agriculture sector are almost completely or largely trained in chemical agriculture; hence, have no orientation in sustainable agriculture. To address this, CIKS will identify and select youth at high school level who have interest in farming. Orientation and training to teachers as well as students on sustainable agriculture will be done in 100 identified schools in Tamil Nadu which have agriculture as a vocational training subject. In addition, CIKS will also work with Shriram IGNOU Community College which offers a two year course on integrated farm management. The students who are admitted to this course are those who have completed high school with vocational training in agriculture. Through these efforts, CIKS will develop a cadre of at least 20 village youth per year with aptitude and orientation in sustainable agriculture.  

CIKS will be 'Up-scaling technologies through convergence' by working with other agencies promoting large scale programmes on agriculture. By using existing programmes already on the ground, CIKS will liaise with Government departments and NGOs so as to upscale several tested technologies in a short time in an effective manner. This way, CIKS will reach out to at least 300,000 beneficiaries in three years.

CIKS was registered as a Trust in 1995 with five founding Trustees and four additional Trustees were inducted subsequently. The board comprises of scientists, industrialists, academicians, an advocate and a medical doctor. All the board members are renowned people in their respective fields. Through this project, CIKS supports small holder farmers in mostly rainfed areas through sustainable agriculture and facilitate in developing their own enterprises. All these are areas of priority within the Green Entrepreneurship programme of Hivos.","2",NA,NA,"2012-09-01","2015-08-31",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"CIKS: Centre for Indian Knowledge Systems",NA,NA,NA,"IN","India",NA,NA,NA,NA,"311","","100","OECD Development Assistance Committee 3 digit codes","DAC-3",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"EUR","EUR",0,"116409","0","0",0,0,0

Centre for Indian Knowledge Systems (CIKS) is a not for profit organisation striving to strengthen and revitalize Indian Knowledge Systems with particular focus on sustainable agriculture and traditional knowledge based health care systems. Biodiversity Conservation, Organic Agriculture and Vrikshayurveda (the ancient Indian plant science having relevance in the areas of ayurveda, agriculture, horticulture and life sciences) form the core focus areas of the organisation. 
CIKS’ initiatives in biodiversity conservation have helped farmers in Tamil Nadu conserve over 180 indigenous seed varieties, hence protecting the dwindling genetic base and giving farmers a way to prepare and overcome stress situations. Moreover, CIKS is engaged in developing feasible and user-friendly programs to help farmers adopt organic agriculture. CIKS has explored the application of Vrikshayurveda in seed treatment, soil testing and preparation, methods for yield increase, identification and treatment of plant diseases, land classification, details of cultivation of plants etc. 

The programmes of CIKS can broadly be classified into research and extension. The research programme draws mainly from the work on the dedicated experimental farm, actual field experiments, and knowledge mining from ancient texts and local folklores. The extension work comprises of training programmes and production of educational material. CIKS undertakes action research, training and extension on various aspects of organic farming, cultivation of organic rice, cotton, oil seeds, vegetables etc. Under its biodiversity initiatives, CIKS has set up rural gene banks for the conservation of traditional seed varieties. The community seed banks promoted in four districts of Tamil Nadu covering 125 villages have a network of 3,000 farmers and have managed to conserve more than 130 varieties of paddy and 50 varieties of vegetables seeds. From the past one year CIKS has been anchoring the seeds node of RRA network. CIKS has also established a resource centre that provides information on organic farming and has been marketing the local organic produce under the brand name of Arogyam.

CIKS came into existence in August 1993, when it was formed as an autonomous centre under the Academy of Development Sciences, Maharashtra. In January 1995 it was registered as an independent trust in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. It works in five districts of Tamil Nadu covering about 12,400 acres of land under organic cultivation. Over the last 17 years, its action research with farmers has demonstrated that apart from reducing the costs of cultivation, organic agriculture enhances the food and nutritional securities of the small and marginal farmers.

Anchoring the seeds node of Revitalising Rainfed Agriculture Network, CIKS would endeavour to promote a deeper understanding on the issues of ‘seed’ in varied rainfed contexts and the nature and functioning of related public investments and institutions. It aims to synthesize existing experiences on various innovations and evolve newer approaches amenable for mainstreaming into public institutions advocating for developing appropriate seeds systems for rainfed regions.

While the Indian microfinance industry has grown over the years, Indian microfinance, in essence, has been largely a single product credit industry, making it imperative to find ways to design basket of products and services to create 'real' financial inclusion. Micorfinance in India has largely been concentrated in a few geographies with limited products which did not address the varied financial needs of the population. Some segments of the population were neglected by both the mainstream financial institutions as well as the microfinance sector. For example, many microenterprises and producer organizations in the agriculture sector came in this 'missing middle' category. Through this Caspian Debt Fund (CDF), Bellwether will address this issue by providing finance to the largely unreached sectors apart from microfinance institutions. 

The Bellwether Microfinance Fund (BMF) is a Non Banking Finance Company in India with Investments from the Hivos Triodos Fund, Gray Ghost Microfinance Fund and other investors. The Bellwether Fund was established when two social investors (Gray Ghost Microfinance Fund and Hivos Triodos Fund) came together with a local entrepreneur/ microfinance professional (Mr.Viswanatha Prasad) in 2005, to establish what would be India's first Microfinance Investment Fund. Since 2005, Bellwether has made twelve equity investments and seventy debt investments. Bellwether was structured as an open ended fund, with no liquidation date. However, now Bellwether seeks to exit partially from its present portfolio and initiate a second portfolio within Bellwether, recycling/ redeploying part of the proceeds recovered from the initial portfolio. This initiative will be referred to as the Caspian Debt Fund (CDF). 

Through CDF, Bellwether would be re-affirming to its broader mission that focuses on delivering flexible and innovative funding support to sectors that have the potential to create greater impact and inclusion of low income and underserved communities across the country. Apart from Microfinance & Micro, Small & Medium Enterprise (MSME) sectors, CDF will extend its rigorous but creative investment approach to other additional areas which are Agriculture & Allied activities and Micro-mortgage/ Housing Finance. Subject to Indian regulation, CDF will extend short term, long term, secured or unsecured debt to Indian corporate and non-corporate entities. It is expected that a significant majority of the loans would be made to regulated and for-profit entities. Within the MSME and Micro-mortgage/ Housing Finance segments, CDF will reach out to the end clients (largely microenterprises in the unorganized sector and low income households for micro housing) through intermediary financial institutions. Within the agriculture and allied activities, CDF would look for opportunities to engage at different stages in the value chain. While the focus would be on producer organizations and will reach out directly to them; CDF would also reach out to private companies engaged in the post-harvest supply value chain after careful examination of the role played by these intermediaries in the value chain.

As a result of this initiative, entrepreneurs (including producer organizations) will be better organized, have more options at their disposal, negotiate better with the market, which in turn will lead to better incomes. CDF would be strengthening organizations and businesses that support smallholder farmers and MSMEs in rural areas; and contribute to sustainable economic development and direct poverty alleviation. CDF will thus will increase the capacities of enterprising people living in rural areas and strengthen their economic position. Hence, Hivos supports this initiative as it directly addresses the objectives of the Green Entrepreneurship programme of Hivos.

Vikas Sahyog Kendra (VSK) is a non-profit organization working with tribal and dalit communities in Jharkhand. VSK's interventions are planned around promoting sustainable agriculture and ensuring food security by advocating for these issues in district and local governance institutions.

In 1997, VSK was registered formally under the societies registration act, 1860. It follows a rights based approach for development initiatives in order to secure access to natural resources, public investments and welfare benefits that contribute to improving livelihoods of adivasi and dalit communities. The approach comprises of organizing and building capacities of primary stakeholders by establishing issue based advocacy forums at multiple levels and providing technical support for implementation. Since its inception, VSK has promoted various community institutions and forums around the key issues of community forest management and labour rights under various programmes. 

The current programmes of the organisation are drawn on ensuring wage and food entitlements provisioned under various public welfare programmes. The organization is also working on channelising resources to develop natural resources based livelihoods. 

The present proposal as part of the Revitalising Rainfed Agriculture Network focuses on carrying out one year of preparatory phase for implementing comprehensive pilots (CPs) in rainfed villages of Chhatarpur block of district Palamau, Jharkhand. RRA programme aims to evolve a comprehensive public policy to realise growth and development potential of production systems in rainfed areas. Enhancing sustainability of natural resources, reducing cost of cultivation and strengthening diverse local production systems to contribute substantially to food and income security of small and marginal farmers in rainfed regions constitute the key elements of RRA programme. These propositions of RRA augment Hivos’ programme efforts in integrating ecological and social considerations into policies on agriculture creating an environment conducive for small producers.

VSK seeks to further the objectives of the RRA network by ensuring greater flow of public investments enhancing the livelihood of the farmers in rainfed areas. The organisation has prepared ‘Panchayat Centric Rainfed Area Plans’ for the current agriculture season and has mobilized labour networks in the villages that will be advocating for resource allocation to projects supporting the rainfed agriculture sub-systems in the villages as conceived by the RRA network.  Harnessing the agency of the rural communities for attaining their full potential is also at the core of the Hivos' Green Entrepreneurship programme.

The project aims towards setting up of team for CP implementations, carrying out situational analysis of rainfed areas of the block along with specific problems and solution and mapping out potential of various ongoing and proposed government programs. At the end of the preparatory phase, VSK would be able to develop detailed proposal for demonstrating comprehensive pilots in larger programme area and the strategy for embedding these into suitable government programmes.

Advanced Centre for Water Resources Development and Management (ACWADAM) is a not for profit organisation having expertise in various branches of earth and water sciences. Hydrogeology being its core strength, ACWADAM engages in action research and education on groundwater management. It is currently facilitating work related to groundwater management in various parts of India, through partnerships with other Civil Society Organisations and with the Government. ACWADAM’s goal is to establish a groundwater management agenda in India, an agenda based on the science of hydrogeology and the principles of managing a “common pool resource” through community participation.

ACWADAM has also provided technical advice to various agencies on specific aspects of groundwater management.  The varied spectrum of work around ground water management has helped the organisation analyze the hydrogeology of different regions in India, diagnose problems of groundwater and seek solutions that attempt to combine practical aspects with larger issues such as sustainability and equity of water resources. With these experiences, ACWADAM has successfully been involved in developing strategies for water resources, especially groundwater, at wider, policy levels. ACWADAM was founded by prominent geologists and registered in 1999 under the Societies Registration Act, 1860. 


The current proposal from ACWADAM to provide support in the thematic area of water for rainfed regions as part of the Revitalising Rainfed Agriculture Network (RRAN). The overall goal of RRAN is to evolve a comprehensive public policy package to realise growth and development potential of production systems in rainfed areas with focus on enhancing sustainability of natural resources, reducing cost of cultivation and strengthening diverse local production systems to contribute substantially to food and income security of small and marginal farmers in rainfed regions. These propositions of RRA augment Hivos’ programme efforts in integrating ecological and social considerations into policies on agriculture creating an environment conducive for small producers.

For the level of public scrutiny and debate in India about the rights of Adivasi's (indigenous people of India) over their resources and issues of governance in these regions, the information that comes into public domain (blogs, newspapers, tv channels, radio) are all reported by non-adivasis who cannot speak the local language and relate directly with the Adivasi's. Therefore the concept of 'Swara' (voice) is relevant and unique, for it provides the Adivasi's access to a voice-based platform simple enough to understand and use to air their aspirations and concerns to a wide range of audience who otherwise will not have a chance to be connected to them.

The fundamental theory of change underpinning Swara is that if conversations and mutual sharing of experiences are facilitated, concerns and aspirations at a mass scale will lead to to improved understanding and positive spirit of partnership between communities and governments and therefore resolve conflict and eases the path towards sustainable progress. 

The project which was first piloted in Chattisgarh in February 2010 was implemented as a way to have people use mobile phones as a mass communication medium by allowing users to record their own content as well as listen to content left by other people via an IVR system linked to a website. The content is moderated by trained volunteers, often professional journalists who edit the content for quality, verify its accuracy and finally publish it to the web and phone interfaces. This simple technological intervention has quickly taken the shape of a community communication platform where people with the most basic technical skills can share their concerns with the world in their own voice. The pilot has logged over 100,000 calls and continues to receive 200-300 calls a day in over five languages. Over 1600 reports from citizen reporters have been published to the web. The content generated on the voice is also included as daily email bulletins that reaches about 4000 people everyday. Members subscribing to this list include Government officials, mainstream media professionals, activists and grassroots leaders. Many-a-time the information that has been shared on Swara has facilitated positive actions and responses by the state as well as analysis and coverage by mainstream media. 

All organizations part of Swara including Environics Trust have a constitutional and fundamental commitment to open sharing of knowledge and information. The audio content at the moment is completely in the public domain with no license associated with it. At the outset of the project we would prefer to keep the content open under a creative commons license. Technology related content, such as source code, and all new technology developed as part of the project will be released into the public domain under a Free Software Foundation approved Open Source License, such as GPL or Apache.

Applied Environmental Research Foundation (AERF) is a registered non-government organization (registered as Charitable Trust on 5 August 1994) based in Pune, India that aims to demonstrate the conservation of biological diversity through the active participation of local communities combined with the use of research techniques. The Foundation aims to address the biological diversity loss of a region by building sustainable development models that would also benefit the areas' local populace. AERF believes in community-based conservation or participatory conservation which implies involving people in the process of conservation which will not only link to ecosystem development, but also aid in poverty alleviation. It's work is spread in the two biodiversity hotspots of India– Western Ghats and North East India. To fulfill its aim, AERF works through five complementary programmes in both the  region i.e Sacred grove conservation, Applied Biodiversity Research, Community, Climate Change and Conservation, Energy & Biodiversity and Business & Biodiversity. AERF manages, monitors and restores biodiversity and habitats on private and community lands as well. The Foundation develops natural resource management models that actively involve local communities in the cause of conservation. AERF has a dedicated team of researchers & practitioners who bring varied expertise, experience and skills supported by an advisory committee of eminent scientists and advisors. AERF also operates through a strong network of organizations including  IUCN and LEAD.
 
In Maharashtra, AERF’s work is spread across four districts - Pune, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg. AERF is active through partnership with communities in about 100 villages with an outreach of around 4000-6000 largely tribal beneficiaries. With the focus on sustainable development through community based natural resource management and enterprise development, AERF has demonstrated the benefits of Straight Vegetable Oil (a kind of Bio-fuel which is extracted from Pongamia pinnata and Mahua) in running any fossil fuel (diesel) powered instruments like Oil expeller, electricity generators, tractors and irrigation pump sets without making any modifications in them, in two districts of Maharashtra. Moreover, the success  of the enterprise was also demonstrated in creating livelihood opportunities for the unemployed youth and tribals through setting up  bio-diesel resource centers which has made a very good case for development of sustainable rural enterprise with high replication potential in different parts of India. 

The support of Hivos is towards successful expansion of the initiative by establishing two decentralized bio-fuel resource centres (for SVO extraction) in the Village Kitadi in Sakoli tehshil of Bhandara district and Village Dolkhamb in Shahapur block of Thane district which will create an alternative livelihood opportunities for about 2000 rural families (including tribals) from 60 surrounding villages and empower them to manage the supply chain of the Straight Vegetable Oil (SVO) right from Seed (Mahua and Pongamia) collection to SVO marketing. By establishing the decentralized bio-fuel resource centres, this project also aims at ensuring a continuous supply of clean bio-fuel in the Thane and Bhandara districts of Maharashtra. The objectives of the planned initiative dovetail well into the mandate of Green Entrepreneurship programme of Hivos.","2",NA,NA,"2012-11-01","2014-10-31",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Applied Environmental Research Foundation [AERF]",NA,NA,NA,"IN","India",NA,NA,NA,NA,"312;230",";","50;50","OECD Development Assistance Committee 3 digit codes;OECD Development Assistance Committee 3 digit codes","DAC-3;DAC-3",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"EUR","EUR",0,"50000","0","0",0,0,0

Based on the non-negotiable principle that ‘no child works and every child attends full time formal school as a matter of right’, Mamidipudi Venkatarangaiya Foundation (MVF) has been working towards abolition of child labour in all forms and mainstreaming children into formal schools for over two decades now.

MVF is rights based organization actively involved in elimination of child labour through universalisation of education and has so far mainstreamed over 1 million children from work into full time formal education. MVF has been crucial in strengthening community ownership towards child rights especially with regard to formal education in 2259 villages in Andhra Pradesh and other states like Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar and Tamil Nadu.  The MVF’s model to abolish child labour has inspired many civil society organisations. Even State governments like Madhya Pradesh and Bihar have invited MVF to provide technical support to implement such an initiative in their states. MVF has also inspired the International Stop Child Labour campaign which is a campaign of NGOs (non government organisations) and unions from 6 European countries who closely work with developing countries to abolish child labour. This campaign was initiated by Hivos. Presently MVF provides technical support in implementing the campaign in various Central American and African countries

Some of MVF’s strategies for mainstreaming of children in school have been proved to be universally replicable. For instance the residential bridge course camps which help in mainstreaming older children who have been out of the school system for longer periods of time have been implemented as part of the State Government’s programme in Andhra Pradesh. Another such initiative is their work on strengthening quality of education by mobilising government school teachers to create student friendly curriculum and low cost educational learning material to enable a creative and fun learning process. They have also mobilised 1500 government school teachers together under the banner of Teachers Forum for Child Rights.

The focus of this phase of Hivos’ support to MVF is two- fold. MVF will leverage on its field experiences to enable effective monitoring and advocacy on the Right to Education (RTE) Act 2009 in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. MVF will work towards building the capacities of  its stakeholders namely community forums, school monitoring systems, gram Panchayats, and teachers so that they work more closely with the government machineries to ensure effective implementation of the RTE Act. MVF will also focus on strengthening its capacities to be a national resource centre on child rights in the country by providing technical support on child rights issues as well as to strengthen advocacy on child rights issues. The other focus of the support is more institutional which is to enable MVF to diversify its donor base especially to sustain their core costs as well as to build their internal capacities on gender issues.

The Mamidipudi Venkatarangaiya Foundation (MVF), a registered trust, was established in 1981 in memory of educationist and historian Prof. Mamidipudi Venkatarangaiya. It began as a research institution on issues relating to social transformation.

MVF’s innovative approach to build the capacities of rural and urban communities for abolition of child labour by universalizing school education is really been effective and Hivos continues to  find value in being able to support MVF’s initiative  through the  Rights and Citizenship Programme in Hivos.

Forum for Integrated Development (FFID) is a not for profit organisation that works with small and marginal farmers towards improving their livelihood options and making farming a sustainable and profitable occupation. The organisation is dedicated to supporting, empowering and strengthening rural communities in coping with adverse situations. It aims to reducing rural distress through livelihoods interventions focusing on natural resource management and agriculture development. With the core belief in minimizing risks and attaining the goal of self sufficiency for smallholder farmers, FFID develops and promotes alternative models of agriculture. The experiences from the field inform the policy and advocacy initiatives of FFID, which aim to reorient policies in favor of sustainable and organic agriculture.

In 2004, FFID initiated its flagship programme, “Chetna Organic & Fair Trade Agriculture Program India (Chetna Organic)”, to support the smallholder cotton farmers from the rainfed regions of Northern Andhra Pradesh, Vidarbha in Maharashtra and South Western Odisha. The region is one of the largest cotton growing regions of the country and has witnessed high famer suicide rates due to the agriculture crisis prevailing in the country.  FFID initiated a composite pilot on Organic / Non-Pesticide Management (NPM) & Fair-trade supply chain development in these regions. With the objective of promoting ownership of the programme among the farmers, in 2007 Chetna Organic Farmers Association (COFA) was registered as a separate organisation under Andhra Pradesh Societies Registration Act, 2001. COFA works as a farmers’ support organization and provides technical and social extension services. The extension programmes range from promoting farmers’ cooperatives and SHGs and implementing watersheds activities for the member farmers to promoting investments from Corporate Social Responsibility programmes in local communities for building infrastructure. 

In addition to COFA, FFID also promoted a farmer owned commodity trading company, Chetna Organic Agriculture Producer Company Ltd (COAPCL), which works on developing sustainable market linkages for farmer’s produce in national and international markets. COAPCL is also involved in training and capacity building of farmer communities on issues such as quality management, local level market development and maintenance of organic standards and certification.

FFID has promoted sustainable agriculture covering 35,000 acres of area through various initiatives on natural resources management, integrated farming systems and value chain development. Having a firm belief in collective action and fair supply chain, FFID expanded its reach from 234 farmer members in 2004 to around 15,300 in 2012. FFID was established on 10th march, 1995 and registered under Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area) Public Societies Registration Act, 1350 Fasli (Act 1 of 1350F).

FFID’s objectives and its propositions as the soil node of Revitalising Rainfed Agriculture Network align with the network’s agenda of demonstrating and arguing for a differentiated policy paradigm for rainfed agriculture and advocating for more equitable investments in rainfed farming systems through sustainable and ecological techniques suitable for rainfed conditions. FFID’s engagement with RRA network will contribute to articulating the policy propositions for investments on enhancing soil productivity in rainfed regions.

Friends of Women’s World Banking, India (FWWB-India) was promoted by SEWA Bank, as an affiliate of Women’s World Banking, a global network created to focus on the need for women’s direct access to financial services and recognizing women’s role in building a nation’s economy. Led by a Board of women leaders representing strong community based initiatives, FWWB’s strategy has been to act as a catalyst with the commitment to build a society based on equity and social justice where women are leaders in social change. Their operations cover the entire country and are an apex network of institutions providing financial services to women from low-income households.  

FWWB acknowledges the importance of individual as well as collective growth as a crucial instrument to the inclusive growth which can be addressed  by access to credit, developing managerial know how to optimize effective utilization of resources and identifying risks and mitigants of the same. Hence, to maximize impact, enhance institutional credit, access to technological inputs, increased livelihoods, FWWB supports organizations both for credit as well as capacity building needs either directly or through linkages.

FWWB combined its loans with technical assistance to ensure sustainable growth, and from 1989 to 2010 it has reached out to more than 300 Micro Finance Institutions (MFIs) with technical assistance and nearly 200 with loan support. With this support, they could provide financial services to more than 1 million low income people through their network in 17 states of India. FWWB has also been providing capacity building support to MFIs that includes operational support in the initial years for start-ups, training by in-house teams and external resources, exposure visits to best practices, etc. 

FWWB was formed as a Society (under the Societies Registration Act 1860) in 1982 as the first affiliate of Women’s World Banking .Currently,it is governed by a 11 member Board of Directors with Ms. Anshu Bhartiya as the CEO.

In 2010, after formidable expansion of its microfinance operations, FWWB hived-off its microfinance activity to Ananya Finance for Inclusive Growth (AFIG) Pvt. Ltd, a non-banking finance company.  FWWB now focuses to work in the areas of livelihood promotion (through its Livelihood and Enterprise Development Program launched in 2007), women empowerment, strengthening institutions and need-based financial products and services that impact the lives of the poor. Under its programme on livelihood and Enterprise development, it has reached approximately 80,000 individuals (as on 31st July 2012) to meet the need of credit, skills enhancement for scaling up operations, access to markets, product designs and increasing business development knowledge  through 16 Partner Organization working in the underserved areas. FWWB in its LEAD Programme provides support to Partner Organizations through two sources-Credit Fund and Technical Assistance. 

FWWB in the last two decades has been a leader at well known livelihood and microfinance forums in India and internationally. It has contributed effectively in policy making, leveraging international best practices and impacting overall development and growth of this sector. 
Hivos’ partnership with FWWB aims to provide handholding support [credit support – incubation finance and working capital] to producer enterprises (of small and marginal farmers - producers both in the farm and allied sectors) in their incubation stages under The Producer Entrepreneurship Catalyst & Incubation Facility (ProCIF) set up by Hivos. Hivos’s contract with FWWB is specifically intended to set up the “Incubation Finance Fund” under the ProCIF programme.

FWWB’s mandate towards providing financial and capacity building services support in order to promote livelihoods and self-reliance of the poor fits well in the current framework of Hivos’ Green Entrepreneurship programme.

WASSAN is a membership based non-profit, support organisation registered as a Trust and started functioning as an independent organisation since December 1999. Prior to this, it was functioning as part of Centre for World Solidarity (CWS) coordinating a network of NGOs to influence the Watershed Development programme of the Government from 1995 onwards. It identifies itself as a National level facilitator for people centred NRM and related livelihoods with enhanced capacities to promote effective network culture and build and service different partnerships. 
WASSAN has emerged as a key capacity building institution at the state level. Its focus is on decentralizing the planning and implementation of development programmes and institutionalising the processes in strong community based organisations. It works on various themes like natural resource management, watershed processes, community organisations etc and provides capacity building support to NGOs and CBOs in implementing watershed and natural resource based livelihoods  programmes.
It mostly works with the Mandal Mahila Samakhyas (MMS)-the federation of SHGs of poor women. Some of the achievements of WASSAN include a) mobilization and formation of network of sheep rearers, fishermen co-operative b) backward and forward linkages for livelihoods initiatives of these co-operatives c) established linkages with research and govt. institutions and successful piloting of many NRM based livelihoods projects.
WASSAN’s work has focused on two streams of work viz. enhanced institutional capacities of CBOs for improving natural resource based livelihoods of the poor living primarily in rainfed areas and advocacy for bringing in improved laws and guidelines for NRM based livelihoods. It acts as a bridge for infusing a bottom-up approach in the Government initiated watershed programmes. WASSAN’s close association with civil society organizations, research institutions and an active engagement with women CBOs facilitate constructive engagement of WASSAN with the Government. WASSAN’s efforts are directly linked with poverty alleviation and strengthening the civil society at the lowest levels. 
As part of the RRA network, WASSAN proposes to coordinate the policy and advocacy initiatives of aiming for enhanced and diffrentiated public investments in rainfed agrciulture and extend support to the comprehenisve pilots and thematic nodes of the network.

Support to producer organizations is one of the focus areas under the Green Entreprenurship programme of Hivos. Hivos has been supporting many partners across India who have a livelihood programme component. Formation and working through groups of producers of different sizes, scales and forms has been a critical strategy across various partners to achieve their livelihood outcomes. But, quite often producers are supported in smaller groups, informal groups, etc. which will require focused effort in making these producers into effective producer organisations. Most importantly, the Facilitating Organisations need to be capacitated to effectively mobilise producers into appropriate producers’ organisations, strengthen them and make these producer organisations ‘market/ trade worthy’. Unless this kind of focused effort is put in, these informal and less-formal groups will remain at the same level, and will not be able to move up in the ladder to use market instruments with respect to credit, market linkages, etc. In this context, Hivos has set up a ‘Small Grant Facility for Facilitating Organisations’to help them in better mobilise and strengthen their producer organisations. The idea is to support Facilitating Organisations (that have a good reach to producers) with funding support to enable them to access services from variety of service providers and ensure development of effective Producer Organisations.   

The Small Grant Facility for Facilitating Organisations (SGF-FO) needs to be managed effectively, as many partners of Hivos and possibly other organisations, would apply and use these funds. This will be done by Vrutti (Livelihood Resource Centre). Vrutti will house and manage effectively the small grant facility to ensure achievement of the key objective of developing and strengthening effective producer organisations. The type of services that can be availed through this fund by facilitating organisations could be – capacitating the organisations about the various forms of producer organisations, legal forms, good practices;  help them in thinking over pros-and-cons of each form and decide the most appropriate form for the producer organisations;  training the POs;  developing participatory strategic and business plans;  identifying market opportunities, products, etc.; development of detailed project report, financial projections; and even testing out the first few cycles of operations to get their capacities built.  

Vrutti, Livelihood Resource Centre works with the vision to contribute to livelihood promotion and improving quality of life of disadvantaged groups of people. Vrutti got registered in 2009 as a not-for-profit organization under the Karnataka Societies Registration Act, Karnataka, India and is part of Catalyst Group of Institutions, a passionate development support group working in the social development sector since 1994. With a mission to alleviate poverty, it works directly with the communities, supports other organisations, networks with individuals working in the area of livelihood promotion and helps them in developing effective strategies, processes, models and support systems through participatory action research, management services and sector level support. Vrutti provides support to variety of organizations viz., Government, multi-lateral and bi-lateral agencies, international and national non-Governmental organisations, community based organisations (CBOs), micro-finance institutions (MFIs) and corporates, in promoting livelihoods for their communities.

This project promotes learning and capacity development on multi-actor initiatives, programme management and project management.

In its business plan 2011-15, Hivos made a strategic decision to gradually reorient its strategy towards supporting programmatic approaches. A diversification of roles is visualised as well.  Whereas Hivos’ traditional strength has been in grant-making, over the next few years Hivos will emphasize other roles more: co-creator, implementer / project manager, facilitator, knowledge hub, innovator, linker and policy advocacy. These are major shifts that require a steep learning curve and strategic investment in learning and capacity development.  Negotiating this curve calls for stock-taking, critical reflection, analysis and synthesis internally as well as drawing from and engaging with external debates and learning processes.

In the course of this project, specific attention will be paid to initiatives in which Hivos is playing roles other than grant-making in order to gain insight into the preparedness of Hivos to play these different roles, how Hivos could be better equipped to play these diverse roles, the tensions between / among the roles, etc.  A number of roles will be looked into; special attention will be given to the project / programme management role and to other roles where Hivos clearly adds value.  The starting point will be systematization and critical reflection on experiences within Hivos.  Simultaneously, opportunities to benefit from new research and the learning processes of other organisations will be identified and seized.  Tracking external debates, and making relevant external insights and resources widely accessible within Hivos will be an important aspect of the project.  

Specific learning questions will be formulated after an initial phase of preparing an inventory of large initiatives that Hivos is currently involved in, and analysing the findings to identify apparent patterns and recurrent concerns.

PRADAN is a voluntary organisation established in 1983 and registered under the Societies Registration Act of India. 

PRADAN believes that the path towards conquering economic poverty is through enhancing the livelihood capabilities of the poor and giving them access to sustainable income generation opportunities.  The programmes are designed to build the technical, organisational, negotiating and networking skills of the poor communities in order to facilitate achievement of their goals. 

PRADAN currently works in around 4,000 villages across eight of the poorest states (Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar, West Bengal and Assam) of India. A majority of the families that PRADAN works with belong to the Schedule Tribes and Schedule Castes. 

PRADAN follows a four-pronged approach to achieve its goals:
•	Promoting and nurturing Self-Help Groups (SHGs) of poor women and strengthening them as organisations to leverage institutional finances for members’ livelihoods.
•	Developing and introducing locally suitable economic activities to increase productivity and incomes among SHG members; building synergic collaboration with a wide variety of stakeholders.
•	Mobilising finances for livelihood assets and infrastructure from government bodies, donors, banks, and other financial institutions.
•	Setting up mechanisms to sustain the livelihood gains made by the poor communities.

PRADAN’S livelihood programmes can be broadly classified into the following sectoral activities: Promotion of SHG's; Forest Based Livelihood, Natural resource management, livestock development and microenterprise promotion

As a strategic principle, PRADAN leverages livelihood investments by linking the rural poor to government programmes and banks.  PRADAN plays the role of a facilitator in such linkages. Additionally, people’s own resources, including savings in self-help groups are also mobilised.  

PRADAN’s objectives and its propositions of the comprehensive pilot of Revitalising Rainfed Agriculture Network proposed in Hirabadh of block of district Bankura, West Bengal align with the network’s agenda of demonstrating techniques appropriate for developing rainfed agriculture systems at scale and advocating for systemic changes to channelize public investment in rainfed farming systems. PRADAN’s engagement with RRA network will contribute to establishing proof of concept of comprehensive livelihoods models in rainfed regions and articulating the policy propositions aiming for enhanced and differentiated public allocations for rainfed regions.

Kislay works with the marginalized urban poor and informal sector workers to ensure their rights and entitlements especially in terms of their dignity and labour rights are protected.
Kislay had facilitated formation of Delhi Shramik Sangathan a federation of unorganized sector workers in Delhi. The member organizations of this federation are   “Delhi Nirman Mazdoor Sangathan” (DNMS), an organization of construction workers and Delhi Gharelu Kamgar Sangathan (DGKS), an organization of domestic workers. The present membership of DNMS is 6500 members and that of DGKS is 1024 members.
 
Kislay focusses on strengthening people’s  organizations to empower workers to claim their labour rights, estabilishing linkages with labour and  other government departments to ensure access to social security benefits and building alliances with other  people’s organisations to strengthen advocacy and influence policy changes. Kislay also actively engages with the slum communities of Delhi on issues of housing and fair distribution of subsidized food grains through creative community media such as theatre. Recently, performances of their street play 'Hum Jaanengey, Hum Jaagengey' (We will know!), generated intense discussion and a people-led campaign against corruption in their local Public Distribution System (for food grains).

Kislay’s’ is one of the few organisations in Delhi that have been able to build people’s organisations of marginalized urban workers as well as expand its membership consistently over the years. Their advocacy work both at the grassroot level and with other actors especially government have yielded significant achievements in terms of policy changes and better implementation of social security benefits. Some of the commendable milestones that they achieved in the recent past are as follows-
•	Registration of around 6382 construction workers in Delhi Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board (DBOCWWB) to avail social security benefits.
•	1500 construction workers received (Rashtriya Swasthya Bhima Yojna) RSBY card for access to medical services.
•	The slum policy of Delhi got amended as per the demands and suggestions proposed by Delhi Shramik Sangathan which in turn will  protect lakhs of informal sector workers living in slum areas from getting displaced from the city.

In the period 2013-14 Kislay will focus on strengthening the capacities of the people’s organisations to enable gender sensitive leadership, increased membership and improved communication skills. They will also work on strengthening linkages with the government labor department for enabling increase in registration of workers and release of social security benefits to workers.  Their advocacy with the State government for influencing policy changes will be done strategically by building alliances with other informal sector networks and peoples’ organsiations in the state.

Kislay is situated in Delhi and registered under the Society’s Registration Act in 1992.

Kislay’s work towards enhancing the participation of urban poor and marginalized workers to claim their labour and other constitutional rights are congruent with the programme priorities of both Unitarian Universalist Holdeen and Hivos.

Sangama (which means confluence) is a human rights organisation focusing on promoting and defending the rights of working class sexual minorities, sex workers and PLHIV. Sangama works with those who face oppression due to their gender non-conformity and/or sexual preference (these include 'Jogappas', 'Kothis', 'Hijras', 'Doubledeckers', bisexuals, lesbians, homosexuals, transgender (M2F and F2M) and others), with sex workers (male-female-transgender) and PLHIV (male-female-transgender). 

Even though the public discourse on issues of sexual minorities in the past couple of years has gained visibility in India, there are still very few organisations that work on the issue with the strategic direction and depth as Sangama. Their main strategy of promoting and strengthening community based organisations, movement building, and capacity building of these communities to ensure that they gain access to their citizenship rights is appropriate, relevant and has gained ground considerably. So much so that it is for the first time that a transgender person has been appointed as staff within the Karnataka High Court and the State Government has passed an order providing welfare rights to all sexual minorities in the state.   

Specifically, Sangama's work has contributed to the empowerment of sexual minorities, sex workers and PLHIV in Karnataka and Tamilnadu through education, advocacy and organising. Sangama's work has broadened and deepened the discourse on sexuality, sex work as profession, HIV status, and the right to sexual health as a fundamental right, linking these issues and the concerns of these social groups with larger social, political and development issues/movements in the country so as to mainstream them. 

Sangama has gained considerable recognition over the years as one of the few organisations in the country dedicated to the rights of diverse sexual minorities, sex workers and PLHIV  which has successfully promoted their interests and empowered them. It has high credibility in the field of human rights and has built strong links with many movements and organisations in the areas of human rights, women's rights, Dalit rights, and child rights. Sangama has contributed considerably to the change in law (Sec 377), which has opened up new areas of work and campaigning.  It is well positioned to advocate the cause of its constituencies and bring about the changes in society and law that are necessary for greater freedom, liberty and equality of the members of the constituencies it works for/with. Sangama's work is essentially collaborative in nature and its overall goal is to promote self determination and self empowerment of these social groups.

Elgar Pratishthan’s core area of engagement is to advocate for the constitutional and legal rights of tribal and marginalized rural communities in blocks of Chandrapur and Gadchiroli districts of Maharashtra. 

Elgar Pratishthan has organized tribal communities into membership organizations namely Shramik Elgar, a people’s organisation of informal sector workers; the Elgar Women’s Credit Cooperative Society; two farmers’ cooperatives in Pomburna and Jivti sub-divisions; and a dairy cooperative. They have been successfully able to collectivize 67contract workers to demand for fair wages and safe working conditions. Similarly through their advocacy and campaigns they have been able to regain agricultural and forest land titles of the tribal communities. Another of their large scale campaign by rural women has been on liquor prohibition in Chandrapur district which seeks to challenge the nexus of the political parties with liquor companies and its implications on violence against women.
In the period 2013-15 the focus of their interventions will be two fold. Firstly to enhance tribal women’s rights to address issues of social security and domestic violence. Secondly to strengthen the capacities of the people’s organisation and the cooperatives to advocate for better implementation of laws related to forest resources, labour and local governance. Some of their planned milestones are 

1.	The  membership of their  people’s organisations  will increase  from 15,000 to 19,000 members 
2.	7000 women will be mobilized to campaign against prohibition of liquor in Chandrapur district in Maharashtra
3.	Ensure an 50% increase in the number of women members in their credit and farmer cooperatives
4.	60 Joint Forest Management Committees will get their fair dues and have greater control over forest produce
5.	 Increased bargaining power of 2000 urban and rural contract factory labourers to demand for timely payments and advocate for change in contract labour act

Elgar Pratishthan was founded in 1999 and is registered as a society and trust. This will be our sixth consecutive year of support to the organisation. Elgar’s ability to mobilize and organise marginalized and tribal communities to demand for their constitutional rights and have increased access to livelihood and financial resources finds high synergy with the programme priorities of both Hivos and Unitarian Universalist Holdeen.

""WASSAN promotes initiatives inspired by community based natural resource management approaches, and focuses on mainstreaming these initiatives. This ensures scale and sustainability of these initiatives. Community based organisations (CBO) are at the heart of all  initiatives; CBO membership has been primarily of women. 

While several CSOs have been working on related issues of management of natural resources, very few have been able to use 'models' to embed them within state policies and programmes.  WASSAN is also one of the few organisations that has been able to work on an integrated systems approach where work on several themes like seeds, water, livestock, crops, soils etc is layered in a common geography.  Its work has gained WASSAN significant recognition at policy levels at the state and national levels. 

WASSAN would be the role model for the implementation of the comprehensive pilots which other CSOs across the country would try to emulate. The comprehensive pilots are key to demonstrating how the public investment regime needs to be structured to achieve higher agricultural productivity gains in rainfed areas.  

WASSAN intends to implement a comprehensive pilot in Daulatabad mandal of Andhra Pradesh. It aims to integrate aspects of seed systems, water management, livestock, inland fisheries, institutions etc into the government programmes and schemes. The uptake of the evidence related to productivity gains and increased food security will be directly into the State policy and programmes.     

As a secretariat of the Revitalising Rainfed Agriculture Network, WASSAN commands substantial respect from CSOs, academia and State alike. Its inclusive approach and strong value system has enabled the growth of the network. 

There is good resonance between the goals of WASSAN with that of Hivos.  Also, congruence in terms of values make WASSAN a natural ally. ""

Parivarttan works with the underprivileged and marginalised tribals in Malkangiri district (the poorest and most neglected district) in southwest Odisha to strengthen peoples' organizations, promote livelihood and food security, community health, advocacy & network building. Parivarttan assists vulnerable groups especially (e.g., women, children, tribals, dalits) to make optimum and sustainable use of locally available natural resources, to increase productivity of these resources, to generate off-farm / non-farm enterprise development, and to enhance access to land, water and forests.  Parivarttan promotes environmentally sustainable and socially equitable development. 

Parivarttan has supported the formation of self-help groups (SHGs) covering income generating activities, and has engaged in trainings, lobby and advocacy and capacity building of tribal communities in sustainable agriculture. The organisation carries a wide range expertise and working experience on livestock, soil and water conservation, seed preservation and mapping and rainfed agriculture-related activities. As mitigation activities, Parivarttan is actively involved in cultivation of paddy through the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) method.  Parivarttan also promotes inter-cropping, vegetable cultivation and the use of bio – fertilizer and pesticide.  Networking and building common platforms at village, block and district levels to streamline government social security schemes meant for the rural poor are important parts of Parivarttan's strategy.   Parivarttan works in close collaboration with various government schemes.  Apart from this, Parivarttan has taken a lead role in developing a network of like-minded organizations in Malkangiri District called ‘Malkangiri Action Group’. This network aims to develop a common platform to advocate for creating fair development policy for the poor and tribal people of Malkangiri district.  Parivarttan along with its network NGOs, works in 250 villages and 10,705 community-based organisations with a prime focus on tribal families. 

Parivarttan was registered as a society in 1994 and became fully functional in 1998. It was founded as a non-political and non-governmental voluntary organization to engage in sustainable development activities.

Parivarttan and the 14-member Malkangiri Action Group intend to improve rural livelihoods and especially food security in Malkangiri  district of Orissa by conceptualizing a comprehensive model of rainfed agriculture,  and to improve rural income through increased local employment opportunities.  Parivarttan anticipates a positive impact on rural governance and intends to share its successful model / approach in the larger domain.  

The programme objectives are in congruence with the goal of revitalising rainfed agriculture, which is a key element of Hivos' Green Enterpreneurship Programme in India.

Over the last two decades, Samaj Pragati Sahayog (SPS) has grown to be one of India's largest grass-roots initiatives for water and livelihood security in around 260 villages of Dewas district of Madhya Pradesh, mainly in the  Adivasi (tribal) belt. This work has enhanced drinking water availability and has sustained employment generation and livelihood security in intervened villages.

SPS believes that location-specific watershed development combined with low-cost, low-risk agriculture, other nature-based livelihoods and women-led microfinance, can dramatically raise rural incomes, providing an enduring panacea to farmers in India's drylands.  SPS has worked out a package of agricultural practices finely tuned to the locally available natural resources and, thus, accessible to the poor (low-cost) and sustainable (low-risk). This approach arrests distress migration and liberates the rural poor from the clutches of usurious moneylender-traders. The central mandate of SPS is to empower India's most disadvantaged people - women, Adivasis, Dalits and the poor - thereby contributing to the strengthening of democracy at the grass-roots.  SPS also focuses on building and strengthening women-led people’s institutions which support participatory and decentralised governance.  Besides, SPS has worked closely with the government in programmes like MGNREGS (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme) to ensure effective expenditure leading to increase in irrigation and creation of sustainable livelihoods.

SPS is a society registered in 1990 under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 and headquartered in Bagli block of Devas District of Madhya Pradesh.  SPS is also a member of Revitalizing Rainfed  Agriculture  (RRA)  Network which  has  109 members spread across rainfed areas of the country, and is emerging as an important platform articulating the issues of rainfed agriculture at the national level.

SPS intends to implement a comprehensive pilot to revitalise rainfed agriculture in 200 villages in and around Bagli block of Dewas District, Madhya Pradesh.  Though this pilot, SPS proposes to formulate the framework and elements of a comprehensive package of rainfed area interventions. 

The programme objectives are in congruence with the goal of revitalising rainfed agriculture, which is a key element of Hivos' Green Enterpreneurship Programme in India.

The Aga Khan Rural Support Programme (India) works as a catalyst for the betterment of rural communities by providing direct support to local communities for activities and to develop models for sustainable use of natural resource and development of human resources. 
After 25 years of committed involvement in the development sector, AKRSP (India) today is working in over 1500 villages in three states of India namely Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Bihar.  AKRSP has been working in over 1100 villages in four environmentally challenged and economically vulnerable regions of Gujarat: the tribal blocks of Bharuch, Narmada, Surat & Tapi districts, coastal salinity-affected Junagadh & Porbandar districts and the drought-prone Surendranagar district. 

AKRSP has innovated and pioneered several initiatives in different thematic areas such as participatory irrigation management, joint forest management, rain water harvesting, watershed development, salinity ingress prevention and alternative energy to improve the quality of land, increase the availability of water for irrigation and introduce new inputs or technologies that improve agricultural productivity and to empower rural women and marginalized communities. Its work in these areas has helped to improve food security, increase agricultural income and reduce risks for the landed farmers and provide livelihood options for the poor and landless farmers. Focusing on landless farmers, families with small holdings and farmers with three acres or less, it has introduced a range of options from systems to improve rice and wheat yields to small-scale vegetable farming and other alternative means of livelihood.

AKRSP was selected as Project Implementation Agency for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) in Madhya Pradesh, which ensures that employment generation schemes lead to productive assets. Distress migration has been reduced by 70-90 percent among farmers and by 30-50 percent among agricultural labourers, according to a research study carried out by the International Water Management Institute titled “Agrarian Transformation Among Tribals: From Migrants to Farmer Irrigators”. AKRSP was the first NGO to implement Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) in Gujarat. Today, there is a PIM Act in Gujarat. AKRSP’s watershed approach has been recognised by Government through a citation of AKRSP in the revised national watershed guidelines.
AKRSP (India) is the part of Global Aga Khan Development Foundation eshtablished by His Highness the Aga Khan in 1984. It began its field operations in 1985 and has since become one of the largest grassroots NGOs in India with more than 250 staff in 27 locations and an annual budget of $6 million. It is also a member of Revitalizing Rainfed  Agriculture  (RRA)  Network which  has  109 members spread across rainfed areas of the country, and is emerging as an important platform for articulating the issues of rainfed agriculture at the national level.

AKRSP will implement a comprehensive pilot project on rainfed agriculture, which aims to  improve rural livelihoods and food security in four districts (Khandwa, Burhanpur, Khargone and Barwani)of Nimar region of Madhya Pradesh.  AKRSP has conceptualized a comprehensive model of rainfed agriculture, which would improve rural income through increased local employment opportunities, and have an impact on rural governance.  AKRSP will share its experience of implementing this model in larger domain.  

The programme objectives are in congruence with the goal of revitalising rainfed agriculture, which is a key element of Hivos' Green Enterpreneurship Programme in India.

Astha Sansthan has supported Association of Women Alone (ASWA) since ASWA emerged as a membership-based self-help organisation of widows and single women in January 2000.  ASWA is one of the many people's organisations that ASTHA has helped to emerge in Rajasthan. The Rajasthan-wide ASWA now has a membership of about 41,000, all low-income rural and urban women who are widowed or separated.  This membership is spread in 33 districts across 132 blocks in Rajasthan. The steady growth of the constituency is indicative of the slow, measured approach that ASWA/Astha takes to ensure as much of effective implementation as possible. The National Association of Women Alone has expanded to seven states with the specific agenda of improving visibility and voice of single women across the country and ensuring that their concerns get reflected in policies and state laws.

The Main Objective of the work with low-income Single Women is to help them to build up organizations of Single Women, to help each other solve the problems they face, to “be there”, as family, for each other, giving strength and confidence to each member of the organizations.  The women collectively will change caste and community customs that are discriminatory, will lobby the government for more resources and better laws and policies for Single Women, will prevent atrocities on Single Women, will help them to claim possession of land rights, and in all ways, be an “alternate family” for the women members.

ASWA and National forum for Single Women’s Rights have been instrumental for lobbying for positive changes in the present policies and legislation concerning single women in Rajasthan.  Their advocacy efforts have led to significant changes in financial schemes for widows and other single women in the past as well in the present as reflected in the government budget (March 2013) where provisions for single women were announced. They have also ensured the concerns of single women are included in the recommendation of the women empowerments’ committee to the Planning commission towards the 12th Five Year Plan.

Both the Association of Strong Women Alone, Rajasthan and the National Forum for Single Women’s Rights are formed for the purpose of enabling low-income Single Women to claim their rights as citizens, and as persons. The Overall Approach is organization, training, expansion, sharing, lobbying and advocacy.

Astha was formed in 1986 and was registered as a Society, under Society Registration Act.

Hivos supports Astha Sansthan/ASWA for its consistent and pioneering efforts to ensure better rights, better lives for women of ASWA and a better society based on values of justice, equality and humanism.

Utthan Trust works with marginalised communities like women, Dalits, adivasis and minorities in the coastal and tribal regions in Gujarat to promote gender equity, social justice and sustainable economic development.

The focus of Utthan’s interventions is on women’s empowerment and livelihood security within the framework of promoting gender equity, human rights and improving the quality of life of its constituency. Utthan primarily works in three coastal districts – Bhavnagar, Amreli and Kutch and two tribal districts – Dahod and Panchmahal. 

Utthan’s key strategy is to organise rural, marginalised women into village level collectives to work towards equality, women’s empowerment, justice, access to basic rights, sanitation, food security etc. The collectives are part of larger federations, with Utthan providing capacity building support and assistance. Utthan has helped form four women’s federations which have an outreach of more than 7000 members. The federations take up a range of activities dealing with the cross cutting issues of gender, women’s rights, conflict resolution, peace building and livelihood security. 

Utthan's early interventions were marked by facilitating and supporting gender sensitization and building a movement of women and other vulnerable groups their empowerment to meet their basic livelihood needs and to protect their resources and to restore the traditional role of communities and households in managing their natural resources in Gujarat. Utthan’s major efforts in the past years have been from a view to deepen and upscale its interventions on gender and empowerment, livelihood security through Integrated Natural Resource management in the context of manmade and natural disasters, as well as on peace and justice through conflict transformation and efforts to ensure human rights. 

It is through the efforts of Utthan that women as individuals, Nyay Samiti, Land Committee members and as representatives of Sangathans have started contesting elections, raising their voices against violence, discrimination in education, inequity in PDS and other human rights violations before authorities, fighting for access to resources for improving livelihoods. Resource augmentation and conservation programmes like Horticulture development in small land holdings in tribal area, watershed development, lobster and crab fattening, agricultural development have had a huge impact on people’s livelihoods and standard of living. Their 4 women federations are successfully revolving savings for livelihood purposes and are now moving towards self reliance and autonomy

In this phase of support from the UUHHJIF [Unitarian Universalist Holdeen Hivos Just India Fund], Utthan will focus on facilitating a smooth transition and building in various mechanisms for sustainability and self reliance of the four federations.  .  

Utthan was registered as a Trust in 1981.

Utthan’s focus on collectivisation and mobilisation of women from marginalised communities finds high synergy with the objectives and programme priorities of UUHHJIF.

Bindrai Institute for Research Study and Action (BIRSA) works towards the rights of adivasis (indigenous tribes) and Dalits in the Adivasi areas of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal and Orissa. 

After being conceived during the height of the campaign for the creation of the state of Jharkhand in 2000, BIRSA has led and taken part in movements for human rights, labour, livelihood and land rights and to retain Adivasi culture. Due to its efforts in the last 20 years, BIRSA has established itself as one of the few civil society organizations in the country directly run and managed by adivasis and other marginalized communities. 

BIRSA expanded into four independent branches – the Human Rights, Resource and Training Centre, the Mines Monitoring Centre, the Campaign for Forest People’s Rights and a women’s wing. BIRSA’s Mines Monitoring Centre initiated the Internship Programme in 2003. According to an evaluation conducted by a 3-member committee in 2005, the internship programme was unique and a significant step to deepen the Adivasi movement. Birsa since 2003 has supported 46 interns of which 18 interns are women.   Many of these interns have returned to their local organisations and made significant interventions in their communities. 

During this phase of support BIRSA will build the capacities of its interns and ex interns to deepen their engagement with their local community organsiations. Birsa will also facilitate the formation of a women’s wing within the community based organisations enabling the participation of atleast 7000 women. Also Birsa will ensure that the participation of women members’ increases to at least 50% in governance, planning, implementation and monitoring processes of the programmes in Birsa and its community based organisations

BIRSA was formally established in 1990 and is a registered under the Society Registration Act. 

As a Just India Fund partner, BIRSA's work contributes to excluded and marginalised citizens claiming space for participation and full citizenship, an important goal of both Unitarian Universalist Holdeen and Hivos

Jana Sanghati Kendra [Centre for People’s Solidarity] is an organisation which works with landless and marginalised agricultural labourers in West Bengal.

The objectives of JSK are: to assist landless poor and marginalised agricultural labourers to develop strong, independent and self-reliant organisations and to inform them about their rights; to create and develop collective programmes to strengthen people’s organisations; to assist rural women to organise and to inform them about their rights; to collaborate with like-minded organisations on local and national-level campaigns, and to encourage a process of dialogue in society through cultural action. 

The catalyst for JSK’s involvement with agricultural labourers was a local wage struggle in 1988, which resulted in the formation of PBKMS [Paschim Bengal Khet Mazdoor Samiti or the West Bengal Farm Workers’ Association], an independent union of agricultural labourers. The union then began taking part in various campaigns and struggles. In 1990, a separate women’s rights organisation - SMS [Shramjeevi Mahila Samiti or The Women Labourers’ Association], was formed within the umbrella of PBKMS. JSK plays a facilitative role towards capacity building of these two organisations. 

While the members of PBKMS and SMS work together on mobilization and collectivization of labourers, SMS keeps its focus on women’s rights, ensuring gender equality within the structure of PBKMS. As of March 2013 PBMKS had a membership of close to 50,000 individuals [all members of SMS are automatically members of PBKMS].

JSK played a proactive role among the several organisations in the country that demanded for a central legislation guaranteeing employment, which resulted in the passage of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act [2005] (NREGA). Subsequently they have been consistently monitoring the implementation of NREGA and ensuring that agricultural labourers get access to its benefits. JSK and PBKMS have worked extensively on the issue of land rights and have taken part in various campaigns against forcible and sometimes illegal land acquisition in the state. Since 2009 JSK has been instrumental in demanding for a Food Security Bill which not just addresses the issues of entitlements but also of food production. This Bill is now in its final stages of discussion in the Parliament.  

SMS has adapted shalishi, a traditional dispute resolution mechanism in rural West Bengal to deal with 900-1000 cases of domestic violence every year.  SMS has taken an active role in preventing trafficking and forced marriages in their areas. Recognition for this work has been was received when SMS was given the Harriet Tubman Award from Free the Slaves in 2009 for its community based anti-slavery work. SMS has been an active member of Maitree, a network of individual women, women’s groups and other NGOs in West Bengal

The focus of the present phase of support to JSK is to strengthen and expand the work of people’s organisations (PBKMS and SMS) facilitated by JSK to move towards self reliance and organise large scale campaigns to ensure better access to  rights, entitlements and dignity of their constituency.

JSK was formally registered in 1984 under the Society registration Act.

As a UUHHJIF partner, JSK's work will contribute to two major goals of Hivos’ Rights and Citizenship Programme: ‘Excluded and marginalised citizens claim space for participation and full citizenship’, and ‘Legislation and policy meet international standards and are implemented in a manner that benefits all citizens and reduces existing inequalities’.

It provides legal and other support to its members. NASVI consistently seeks to expand its membership and makes concrete efforts to reach out to newer areas. It effectively collects and disseminates information pertaining to street vendors through its website, newsletter and leaflets.

NASVI has been very successful in giving street vendors a unique identity of their own, and by bringing them together at the national level; it has ensured that they have strong collective bargaining powers. NASVI was also instrumental in lobbying with the national government to set up the ‘National Policy for Urban Street Vendors [2004]’, which mandates a strong legal framework to protect and promote street vending in the different states. Post which NASVI been able to successfully advocate for a Central law for street vendors with a view to protect the fundamental right of livelihood of street vendors.

SEWA Bharat is a national federation of Self-Employed Women’s Associations [SEWAs], which are essentially people’s organsiations of self-employed workers and women in the unorganised/informal sector across India. 

SEWA Bharat seeks to actively engage with women workers who have no fixed employer or employer-employee relationship and to build their collective identity. These women workers are engaged in professions such as agriculture, fruit and vegetable vending, construction work, tailoring, embroidery work, silk weaving etc. The objective of the federation is organise women workers in the informal sector for employment and for self reliance in decision making. 

SEWA Bharat’s strategy includes organising women workers, facilitating access to social security and, microfinance including insurance, capacity building of women workers, training, facilitation support, business development services, education, media outreach and lobbying with the government for better policies at the national and state level. SEWA's members campaign for justice, visibility, and for recognition of their place in the economy. In parallel, the members are involved in building and strengthening their own women’s organisations, unions, and producer groups/companies. These organisations create employment opportunities, develop financial services, undertake trainings, and ensure members’ access to health and child care, housing and child care. 

.SEWA Bharat was formed in 1984 as a federation to bring together the various SEWAs, and to support them as and when needed. SEWA Bharat was built on the momentum created by the ‘SEWA movement’. In 1972, the first registered trade union of women informal sector workers named SEWA [Self-Employed Women’s Association] was established in Gujarat. SEWA was formed with the contention that a union was needed to promote unity amongst workers as there was no relationship between employer-employee in the case of informal and home-based workers. SEWA [Gujarat] and SEWA Bharat have derived their inspiration from the labour, cooperative and women’s movements. 

SEWA Bharat has made critical contributions to women informal sector workers in India by providing opportunities for improvement in incomes, empowering women for decision-making and creating a strong regional and national identity for its members. SEWA Bharat has succeeded in its objective of developing new SEWAs; strengthening smaller SEWAs; facilitating linkages for and between SEWAs; and building a national identity for SEWAs. SEWA Bharat has a membership of more than 1,300,000 women members with 15 units across New Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Uttrakhand, Bihar, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Kerala.

In the period 2012-13, Sewa Bharat will work towards strengthening institutional capacities of member organisations of SEWA and providing support towards livelihood development in 5 regions across 4 States of the country (Delhi, Rajasthan, Uttrakhand and West Bengal).  It will also focus on lobbying and advocacy for better implementation of laws and schemes related to worker entitlements benefiting at least 3, 16,000 women workers. 

SEWA Bharat was established as a trust in 1984, 12 years after the establishment of the first SEWA in Gujarat. 

As a UUHHJIF partner, SEWA Bharat’s work will contribute to the ability of excluded and marginalised citizens to claim space for participation and full citizenship - an important goal of Hivos’ Rights and Citizenship Programme

SHARC [Samuel Hahnemann Associates and Research Centre] is a civil society organisation based in Hazaribagh, Jharkhand, which works with rural women and adolescent girls from marginalised and minority communities.

The objective of the organisation is to lay the foundation for a society that reflects the principles of equality and justice, without discrimination on the basis of gender, caste, religion etc. SHARC engages in the following areas: socio-economic development of women through the creation of Self-Help Groups [SHGs], women’s empowerment and leadership development, health and education, and on the protection of the environment., ENSS Jharkhand presently has a  general membership of 14,423 women.

In 2005, SHARC facilitated the formation of a state-wide coalition ‘Ekal Nari Sashakti Sangathan [ENSS] Jharkhand or the ‘Association of Empowered Single Women’. ENSS Jharkhand was formed to take up the issues of widowed, separated, single and abandoned women in the state, who were facing, and continue to face a range of problems – social ostracisation, lack of property rights, lack of food security, vulnerability to atrocities, lack of access to government schemes and entitlements, illiteracy, poverty etc. SHARC  took inspiration from the pioneering effort of Astha Sansthan in creating the ‘Association of Strong Women Alone’ in Rajasthan. 

ENSS Jharkhand has been successful in developing a collective identity for widowed, separated and single women and has provided them a platform to take up various issues. Their important achievements over the past few years include the following: 86 widowed, single and separated women filed nominations for the local self-government elections, with 17 winning their seats; 20791 applications for various government schemes were filed, with 5272 women benefitting; and more than 200 cases were filed in courts on behalf of single women. Due to its policy/advocacy initiatives, the Jharkhand government announced priorities for single women in various  policies, and  single women were included as a separate category in the state government’s draft policy for Women and Child Development. ENSS Jharkhand is now an active member of the National Forum for Single Women’s Rights.

In this phase of support ENSS will work towards strengthening and expanding its membership, building the leadership capacities of community leaders towards advocacy and lobbying and ensuring single women get access to their land.

SHARC was formally registered  in 1996.

Dalit Foundation’s mission is to be a partner in the struggle to eliminate caste-based discrimination and ensure equality and equal rights for all. Dalit Foundation focuses on working for the rights of Dalit communities, especially Dalit women and the scavenging communities.

The caste system which is based on the notion of purity and pollution has plagued the Indian society for almost 3000 years. The Dalits occupy the lowest position in this social system of segregation. Subjected to the practice of untouchability and social discrimination, they are not only denied access to common property (water, land) but are also denied equal opportunities in education and work. 

The main objectives of DF are to eradicate untouchability, social discrimination and caste-based atrocities with special focus on Dalit women and the scavenging community; strengthen Dalit livelihoods (minimum wages for labourers in the unorganized sector) and assist communities reclaim rights over common property and other means of production. 

Their interventions are mainly the following- supporting initiatives led by Dalits, strengthening existing initiatives with grants; promoting and supporting Dalit leaders through fellowships; training of Dalit Youths on perspective building, and project management; training of Dalit individuals from professional institutions and capacity building of partner organisations and fellows. 

Strengthening Dalit movement and building youth leadership is one of the key  focus areas of Dalit Foundation. In the last five years they  have identified  and mentored 143 leaders  of the Dalit movement across 15 states of the country with at least 40 % of these leaders being women. In the past four years Dalit Foundation has been supporting initiatives to advance Dalit rights in 19 states of the country.

In this phase of support Dalit Foundation will focus on developing a strong line of young Dalit leadership and building their perspective, capacities and skills to advance Dalit rights within grassroot level initiatives in Tamil Nadu

Dalit Foundation (DF) was registered on June 2003 at the Public Trust office at Ahmedabad

Centre for Environment and Food Security (CEFS) was founded with the broad objective of knowledge based activism on issues of poverty, hunger, food security, sustainable development and ecological security. Research, advocacy and campaign on these issues are the core mandate of CEFS.

 The other objectives are: to disseminate awareness about environment and food security; to build a resource centre on environment, food security and sustainable livelihoods; to conduct intensive campaigns with media to highlight issues of environment and food security; and to promote strategies for conservation of natural and human managed bio-diversity, which have implications for food and human security. 

CEFS has over the past five years carried out field studies on the performance of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) in Bihar, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, parts of which have been supported by Hivos. CEFS survey reports have been widely acknowledged by government departments, ministries; various official inquiries were undertaken, several questions in Indian Parliament were asked on these reports and these reports have got unprecedented media coverage. The Supreme Court has accepted the findings of CEFS and many landmark decisions have been taken at state and national levels to improve the implementation of MGREGS and to improve the lives of millions in these states.

Considering the state of Andhra Pradesh has managed to ensure relatively better implementation of MGNREGA the Supreme Court has asked the CEFS to explore the best practices in the implementation of the MGNREGA in Andhra Pradesh that can be replicated across the country. The focus of this year’s support is to enable CEFS to document best processes and practices in the planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the NREGS in Andhra Pradesh. Just India Fund supports CEFS for its approach and work to promote citizen participation and ownership to promote transparency and accountability in governance.

The Centre for Environment and Food Security (CEFS) was founded in April 2001 by eminent scholars, writers, environmentalists, scientists and activists.

Centre for Indian Knowledge Systems (CIKS) works towards strengthening and revitalization of Indian Knowledge Systems with particular focus on sustainable agriculture and traditional knowledge based health care systems. Broad areas of CIKS’ interests and interventions are Biodiversity Conservation, Organic Agriculture and Vrkshayurveda (Science of discovering the traditional Indian agricultural practices). Apart from this, CIKS has been taking initiatives as thematic node on Seed under RRA Network.  CIKS initiatives in biodiversity conservation have helped farmers in Tamil Nadu conserve over 180 indigenous seed varieties - hence protecting the dwindling genetic base and giving farmers a way to beat stress situations. The solutions developed and provided by CIKS under Organic agriculture has helped many farmers to switch over from chemical farming.

The activities of CIKS can broadly be classified into research and extension work. The research activity comprises work on the dedicated experimental farm, actual field experiments, and mining knowledge from ancient texts and local folklore. The extension work comprises training programmes and production of educational material. Under this, CIKS is undertaking action research, training and extension on various aspects of organic farming, research on cultivation of organic rice, cotton, oil seeds, vegetables etc. It has set up rural gene banks for the conservation of traditional seed varieties, developed the use of biological control agents for the control of pests in different agro ecosystems, research on the applications of Vrksh Ayurveda (traditional Indian plant science). It has also set-up an organic farming resources centre which would act as a clearing house for information on organic practices. It has been marketing the organic produce locally under the brand name of Arogyam. 

CIKS was registered as a Trust in 1995 with five founding Trustees and four additional Trustees were inducted subsequently. The board comprises of scientists, industrialists, academicians, an advocate and a medical doctor.

CIKS works in 10 districts of Tamil Nadu covering about 12,400 acres of land under organic cultivation. It works directly and indirectly with about 13,00,000 farmers(9,00,000 men+4,00,000 women) mainly related to sustainable agriculture. Over the last 17 years, its action research with farmers has demonstrated that apart from reducing the costs of cultivation, organic agriculture enhances the food and nutritional security of the small and marginal farmers. The community seed banks have managed to conserve seeds of a large number of traditional varieties of paddy and vegetables, which has been an empowering experience, especially for the community women.

Implementing the comprehensive pilot of RRA, CIKS will be contributing in generating the evidence to support the policy agenda of RRA advocating for enhanced and differentiated investment in rainfed agriculture.

ROSE has planned to establish a Farmer Producer Organisation (FPO) in Pudukkottai district of Tamilnadu. The FPO will be registered as a Producer Company with 750 members as shareholders for aggregation and collective marketing of the produces. This project will help the small producers who are increasingly leaving dry land farming to continue farming to ensure food security and increase income flow. 

ROSE has been working with the small farmers   in the area for the past few years with the support of NABARD and other NGO donors for promoting organic farming and collective marketing and has good rapport with the farmers in the intervention area. As part of their intervention, about 1000 small farmers in the semi-arid region is trained in organic production of paddy and minor millets and aggregated the produces and has initiated  marketing in a small way. However, ROSE did not have the required finances to move further and register a FPO and move forward in furthering their intervention. 

As part of this project, ROSE will:
•	Establish and register a FPO with  750 small farmers through a democratic process
•	Train farmers in sustainable / organic production technologies
•	 Develop business plan and establish markets for the produces
•	Support the FPO in value addition of the produces

ROSE was registered as a trust in 1993 by a group of young volunteers who consisted of farmers and social activists. The focus of ROSE is to work for the empowerment of marginalized communities such as: women, children, small farmers, unorganized laborers and dalits through education and awareness campaigns.

Women’s Collective is a collective of rural women spread over in 15 districts in Tamil Nadu promoting the socio-economic and political rights of women, children and elders of marginalized communities.

Women’s Collective was formed with five or six smaller organisations coming together by a process facilitated by Ms. Sheelu Francis in 1994. The process which was very intensive took about 8 years for the groups to come under the umbrella of Women’s Collective and form grassroot federations of member collectives in districts. They are a membership based organisation with a present membership of 26,078 women members. The executive board and the core group that is responsible for planning and implementation comprise of elected members from the collective. They have about 32 unit offices in 15 districts of Tamil Nadu. Their constituency is largely landless Dalit women.

Women’s Collective has intensively worked on issues of women rights such as violence against women, political participation of women in village councils and strengthening food security of women farmers. Over the last few years they have addressed at least 760 cases of violence against women and enabled more than 200 women to get elected in village councils. Their work on collective farming and millet cultivation has received recognition and yielded positive interventions from the government. Women’s Collective is the recipient of 2013 Food Sovereignty Prize from the US Food Sovereignty Alliance. Along with Millet network of India, Women’s Collective has played a major role to ensure millets are included as subsidised food grains in the public distribution system.

The focus of this year’s support is to enable 500 Dalit women farmers to organise themselves to undertake collective farming, build community seed banks and  work with their respective village councils to improve awareness and interventions on food security and other agriculture related issues faced especially by women’s farmers.

The Just India Fund supports Women’s Collective due to its ability to enhance the participation and promote the socio-economic rights of marginalised women especially in the area of food security.

Women’s Collective is registered under the Tamil Nadu Societies registration Act 1975 in 2001

Nivedita Foundation is guided by what it refers to as ‘alternative development thinking and practice’ while implementing various programmes with Dalits, tribals, women, and children and initiating and working with groups, forums and organisations in Orissa and Chattisgarh.

In 2007, Nivedita Foundation expanded its operations to neighboring Chattisgarh, where it was instrumental in setting up the state-level women’s forum Chattisgarh Mahila Manch [CMM].  CMM, which comprises individual activists and women’s collectives, has framed its interventions within a feminist philosophy of equality and a life of dignity and respect for all. Nivedita Foundation/CMM has made significant progress in altering the power relations in favour of women in its working area, which currently comprises of 10 districts. The membership of CMM has increased from 1361 to 4448 members from 2011 to 2013

Some of it significant interventions in 2012 include building the leadership capacity of 36 grassroot women elected leaders of local governance bodies in Chattisgarh. CMM members helped 290 women to secure joint land titles with their husbands, thereby protecting their property rights as women. CMM has monitored of the implementation of various government schemes and policies like the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act and the Forest Rights Act. In addition to strategic inputs in helping women get elected to Panchayat Raj institutions and tackling the issue of land displacement, activists from Nivedita Foundation/CMM have assisted women to seek legal recourse in cases of violence and discrimination. Their state level advocacy on issues of alcoholism and violence against women has resulted in positive interventions by the State machineries.

The focus of this year’s support is to enable CMM to undertake an intensive organization development process that would help them to consolidate and strengthen their structure and systems at both state and district levels. The focus is also to strengthen the leadership capacities of the local collectives affiliated to CMM so that they move towards greater autonomy and self reliance.

Nivedita Foundation’s planned activities and outputs for CMM, and its specific focus on women’s rights, are in close agreement with the programme priorities of the Just India Fund.

Nivedita Foundation is registered as a trust in 2004 in Kalahandi District in Orissa.

Jashpur Jan Vikas Sanstha (JJVS) works towards promoting the social, political and economical rights of Adivasi women in. Chattisgarh.

JJVS nurtures the Adivasi Mahila Mahasabha (AMM) which organises Adivasi women to protect their rights and also engages in state level advocacy to ensure better implementation of laws related to Adivasi communities. AMM has a total membership of about 10000 Adivasi women across the districts of Jashpur, Sarguja, and Raigadh in North Chattisgarh. The birth and growth of AMM as a collective has been a slow and organic one since it is a completely community owned and managed structure. Given that the local women speak only the dialects of Agariya and Bagheli the process of mobilising and collectivising these women and building their leadership skills to interface and negotiate their rights with both the state as well as within their communities has been a long journey. Over the past years AMM's biggest success has been in starting a public debate within the Tribal community on women's ownership of assets (land, income etc) and the success of the Anti-Liquor Campaign in Gholeng panchayat which made them a prominent name in the civil society of Chattisgarh.

The focus of this phase of support is to build capacities of 20 new community based organisations and community leaders to ensure better advocacy on Adivasi related issues.

Just India Fund the joint fund of Hivos and the USA-based Holdeen India Programme supports JJVS because of its specific focus on nurturing and supporting new and young women's and human rights community based organisation.

Development of Humane (DHAN) Foundation [DF] is a professional development organisation incorporated as a Trust under the Indian Trust Act (1882) on 2 October 1997. Its mission is - ""Building people and institutions for development innovations and scaling up to enable the poor communities for poverty reduction and self-reliance”.  The Foundation works towards bringing significant changes in the livelihoods of the poor through innovations in themes and institutions. The broad purposes for which DF works are as follows - 1. To promote and nurture new ideas on development themes; 2. Promoting Institutions to reach scale; 3. To bring young professionals into the development sector. 

Agricultural biodiversity is the cornerstone of agriculture and sustainable livelihoods. Many organisations and individuals have been working to enhance the conservation, management and use of agricultural biodiversity for the past decades. However, most of these initiatives have not been able to scale up and remain in the margins. 
Key to the wider adoption of promising models is political buy-in by decision makers in government bodies. There is a need to invest in building positive attitudes and knowledge with decision makers to motivate them to act in their spheres of responsibility.  In India, there are three precedents on how positive attitude and knowledge on the part of decision makers can lead to large scale adoption. They are 1) Self help group (SHG) model of financial inclusion of the unorganised poor, 2) Watershed based development through community organisations and 3) Joint forest management. There is an opportunity to adopt a similar approach to rally the support of policy makers to scale up agricultural biodiversity initiatives.

Centre for Sustainable Agriculture is a professional resource organization engaged in establishing models of sustainable agriculture working in partnership with NGOs and Community Based Organizations by scaling up the successes and engaging with the establishment for a policy change. 

CSA believes in promoting sustainable agricultural technologies that are based on farmers’ knowledge and skills, their innovation based on local conditions and their use of nature’s products and processes to gain better control over the pre-production and production processes involved in agriculture. CSA works with farmers to conserve their resources and their rights. 

The seed sector in India (and globally) is increasingly driven by proprietary controls, turning seed into a ‘commercial proprietary resource’. This trend has severe impacts on farmers and their informal seed systems, resulting in increased economic and ecological costs and making farmers lose their control over their productive resources.  The existing legal framework in India primarily upholds breeders' and researchers' rights, granting farmers only residual rights. 

The development of an Open Source Seed System provides an alternative institutional and legal framework which protects farmers’ interests and ensures free access the germplasm.

Centre for Sustainable Agriculture is a professional resource organization engaged in establishing models of sustainable agriculture working in partnership with NGOs and Community Based Organizations by scaling up the successes and engaging with the establishment for a policy change. 

CSA believes in promoting sustainable agricultural technologies that are based on farmers’ knowledge and skills, their innovation based on local conditions and their use of nature’s products and processes to gain better control over the pre-production and production processes involved in agriculture. CSA works with farmers to conserve their resources and their rights.

Great initiatives that build on agricultural biodiversity to increase resilience in farming systems can be found all over the world, but often they do not change things at a larger scale. Why is that? Why don't they make a bigger difference? How can we make sure that they have greater impact? A better understanding is needed of the factors that enable the successful scaling up of positive change for more resilient farming systems.

Developing a conceptual framework and criteria on good practice for agro-biodiversity based resilient farming, identifying cases where such practices have successfully reached scale and analysing their preconditions and impact, can generate insights that can help these solutions to transform from local islands of success into strategies that are transferable to other places and other contexts.

Welthungerhilfe is the implementing partner of the TAFS program (Technical Assistance Facility & Services for transforming small Producers Organization's into Enterprises) in India. 

This program aims to enable small/marginal farmers (having 5 acres or less land) including tenant farmers and share croppers to become self-reliant producers. This is to be achieved by creating greater opportunities for these farmers - through Producer Organizations (POs) - to access financial services and markets. This will lead to increased incomes and employment. 

Rain-fed agriculture, climate change, poverty and food insecurity characterize the Indian countryside. These small producers are dependent on traders, input suppliers and moneylenders for growing their crops.  There is clear evidence  that producers organized as Producer Organizations have the capacity to set up successful businesses, break dependency relations and contribute to poverty reduction and food security through environmentally friendly production. There is also clear evidence that access to proper technical assistance (TA) and working capital is one of the principal problems to scale up. Producer Organisations are not victims, but the agents of change. The program expects to improve the living conditions for over 25,500 producer families representing approximately  127,500 rural people in India

DISHA (Developing Initiatives for Social and Human Action) is a not-for-profit, non-government organisation, founded in 1985 and working among the tribals in Gujarat. The objective of DISHA is to bring about social equity, and to increase the self-respect and self-confidence of adivasis so that they can assert their rights. DISHA is engaged in facilitating collective mobilisation and social action among the tribals, to enhance their knowledge, skills, leadership, as well as bargaining power. 

Over the years Disha has accomplished much, getting forest land regularised for over 80,0000 families, facilitating regularisation of daily wage workers, achieving  an increase in minimum wages for farm labourers, etc. For 25 years now, Disha has been championing the land rights movement in Gujarat. Many forest dwellers lack formal entitlements to forest land or access to water. Moreover, the productivity of the land is poor. 

Effective advocacy is required to stimulate policy makers to adopt policies and measures that facilitate access to natural resources and provide opportunities for sustainable livelihood improvement. To address this need, the current project aims to strengthen a mass movement for the right to water, forest land development, and food security. It works from a women’s perspective, focusing on poor women who form a marginalised group in Gujarat. The project intends to enable these women to lead a mass movement advocating for the right to water and forest land. During the project period, Disha will develop and execute several training initiatives for women and community organizations in Gujarat to build relevant competences to this purpose. 

DISHA is an umbrella organization and has adopted different organisational structures to facilitate the process of raising and addressing various issues effectively. For instance, as a trust DISHA raises public interest issues; as a trade union (Agricultural Labour Union, Forest Workers Union), it monitors and fights for the implementation of laws and policies; and as a district-level organisation (Land Rights Protection Committee), it takes up cases of harassment of adivasis, land transfer, etc. DISHA's approach is rooted firmly in the village-level institutions, which the tribals have formed and strengthened to ensure sustenance of the movement. 

DISHA has a governing body of seven members, including five tribals (four of whom are woman). The Managing Trustee of DISHA is tribal and almost 85% of programme staff is from the tribal community. Disha currently supports 37 community-based organisations by means of legal support and training on different laws and legislations. 

This will be fourth phase of support to DISHA by the Unitarian Universalist Holdeen Hivos Just India Fund (UUHHJIF). DISHA’s planned activities and outputs, and its specific focus on the rights of tribals, are in close agreement with Hivos’ Rights and Citizenship programme for the 2011-15 Business Plan.

The National Association of Street Vendors in India (NASVI) is a coalition of street vendor organisations, trade unions, community-based organisations, NGOs, and individual activists that seek to advance the rights and entitlements of street vendors in the country. 

NASVI was formed in 1998 as an informal network of 20 street vendor organisations and was formally registered in 2003 as a society. It's interventions and initiatives are led from its coordination office in New Delhi. NASVI currently has more than 366,000 members representing 702 organisations across 23 states. 

Using a combination of approaches, NASVI has helped to curb and tackle some of the common difficulties faced by street vendors in urban and semi-urban cities and towns in India – unlawful evictions, confiscation of goods, cash extraction, harassment, lack of access to financial services and support etc. 

Last year, NASVI put much effort in the establishment of the Street Vendors’ Bill. Now that this bill has been passed, the current project will focus is on the implementation of the Central law (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street vending Act). Information sharing and awareness raising among stakeholders about this law is essential to ensure that the law is well understood and implemented. In this regard it is necessary to educate the street vendors about the rights that this law provides them and also to sensitize the municipal authorities as they are the main authority to implement the law at the grassroots level. Moreover, NASVI will continue to focus on the strengthening of NASVI member organisations and the broadening of the Association's reach. The current project will also strive to achieve increased women membership and will focus on the capacity building of female members.

The project will focus on the states of Delhi, Kerala, Karnataka, M.P, Punjab, Orissa and Maharastra.

The National Consortium (NCS) is supported by Hivos as a partner of the RRA Network. The RRA Network is a coalition of civil society organisations, research institutions, government agencies and departments and donors who argue for increased investments in rainfed areas. The Network documents and synthesizes lessons from field experiences. To this end the Network has given shape to various nodes in the network around areas of soil, seeds, water, millet-based cropping systems, fisheries, livestock, credit, markets and institutions in order to carry out field pilots and  build the case for an alternative paradigm of investments in these areas. The Network also generates large-scale field experiences through comprehensive pilots in convergence with government programmes to strengthen the case for more and different kind of investments. In addition, the Network is involved in policy advocacy.

NCS is the node for the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) in the RRA Network. The National Consortium on System of Rice Intensification (NCS) is a loose association of multiple stakeholders including civil society organisations, research and resource institutions, and experts who have come together to take forward the cause of enhancing the scale of SRI practice and policy in India. The NCS is engaged in policy dialogue and field based research, and reaches out to relevant stakeholders to push the case for up-scaling SRI and similar agro-ecological innovations. The NCS works towards promoting science, practice and policy engagement on SRI with the objective to empower farmers to meet household and national food security. The NCS and its members have promoted SRI techniques in multiple crops among 150,000 farmers through the help of other donors like WWF and the Tata trusts.
 
 NCS  has proposed to host a national science and policy seminar on SRI on the topic “Changes in rice production: New Insights on the System of Crop Intensification (particularly SRI) as a socio-technical movement in India.” The seminar will be organised in collaboration with Wageningen University (the Netherlands) and XIMB (Xavier Institute of Management Bhubaneswar) and take place in New Delhi from 19 to 21 June 2014. 
The seminar will help in disseminating updated knowledge of SRI among researchers and practitioners from various backgrounds and regions. The science seminar (“New Insights on SRI as a socio-technical movement in India”), will discuss the scientific findings of the various studies conducted and will facilitate the creation of better SRI promotion policies at the state and national level. It will also be a great platform for Indian researchers and practitioners to build a stronger network for further research on System of crop Intensification (SCI) with perspectives from some of the leading researchers in the world. 

The policy seminar (“Food security and rural Livelihoods: Prospects Policies and Challenges in System of Rice Intensification in India”) will specifically look at how more public resources can be channelized to popularize and upscale innovative practices such as SRI through the mainstream programmes of the ministries of rural development, agriculture, tribal development etc. This seminar will provide stakeholders a platform for policy dialogue.

NCS is hosted by the PSI (People's Science Institute), , a non-profit research and development organization that was founded in 1988. Its mission is to help eradicate poverty through the empowerment of the poor and the productive, sustainable and equitable use of available human and natural resources. The RRA Network feels that the synergies that NCS brings to RRA strengthen the overall objectives of both the networks, which in turn will benefit large numbers of rainfed farmers in the country. The wide adoption of SRI techniques in paddy and other crops through public investments would contribute a great deal to the national food security in a sustainable way. The science and policy seminar proposed contributes to the support for and adoption of SRI practices, and therefore aligns well with Hivos' Green Entrepreneurship programme.

The National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) recognized the problem and has set a target of 50 percent of interventions to be implemented by the Community Based Organizations (CBO) by the third year of the National AIDS Control Programme III.  The program will lay out the importance of addressing holistically vulnerable factors that increase risky behaviour, and affect the ability of communities to protect them against discrimination and violence which in turn obstructs access to service.

UN-Habitat recognises this as a ""gap"" and is in a position to demonstrate how appropriate water and sanitation options can be integrated into reconstruction and rehabilitation of settlements in the flood affected areas. Since the frequency and severity of floods in the region is likely to increase due to global climate change and increased glacial melt, this proposal will demonstrate an adaptation response with a focus on ensuring access to water and sanitation for affected people. The project will cement partnership of cooperation and support between the target groups and local government during project implementation. 
In Nepal, the project aims to complement a newly planned settlement by introducing appropriate water and sanitation facilities before the development works are completed and communities settle down. 
In India, the project will promote access to water and sanitation facilities. The proposed intervention is expected to create a demonstration impact for the communities and local government administration in other affected districts. It will also serve as an example of effective collaboration between UN-HABITAT and private sector donors.","2","2009-12-15","2012-12-31",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"BASF",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Lumanti Support Group for Shelter",NA,NA,NA,"none;IN",";India","50;50","798","Asia, regional",NA,"43030;16030;14030","Urban development and management;Housing policy and administrative management;Basic drinking water supply and basic sanitation",";;","OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee","DAC;DAC;DAC",1,"110",20,"CO1","CO1","USD",NA,0,"0","120298","142573",0,0,0

In 2012,WFP phased out of direct implementation of food aid and redirected its partnership toward pure technical assistance and capacity development to contribute to the country's efforts to achieve the goal of zero hunger.

Initially,the current country programme (2008 to 2014) in India focused on reducing food insecurity and malnutrition through the introduction of innovative nutritional food options suitable for consumption by different vulnerable groups and at various physiological stages of life cycle such as pregnancy,such as children under 2 years of age or people living with HIV and tribal populations. From mid-2012 onwards,the emphasis gradually moved to providing technical assistance to government programmes through an active role in policy advocacy,with the objective of eventually increasing the operational efficiency and nutritional effectiveness of India's vast ongoing safety net programmes to reach the targeted vulnerable population. The shift in WFP's objectives was in line with government priorities and the lower middle-income country status of India.

In 2014,WFP continued to support the strengthening of government capacity in the planning and implementation of food safety net schemes. Primarily,WFP's efforts revolved around TPDS reforms for improved beneficiary coverage,leakage reduction and responsive systems,with a focus on targeting,supply chain efficiency,effective grievance redressal and operational viability at the ground level. Activities also included research on the TPDS food basket and on devising strategies for improving its nutritional content. These improvements could potentially impact more than 800 million people in India,who are covered by the public distribution system but currently not receiving optimal benefits due to inefficiencies in the system.

The above activities on technical assistance and capacity development are aligned with WFP's Strategic Objective 4.","3","2008-01-01","2014-12-31","2008-04-01","2015-08-31",NA,"XM-DAC-41140","Multilateral",40,NA,"India","Government",10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"XM-DAC-41140","Multilateral",40,"IN","India",NA,NA,NA,NA,"74010;12240","Disaster prevention and preparedness;Basic nutrition","0;0",";","1;1",4,"110",10,"B02","5","USD",NA,21063567,"0","21063567","13262164",0,0,0

Extension would allow the Bank team to continue to oversee and provide technical inputs on what is a particularly innovative component of the project, the Risk Sharing Facility (RSF).
