registration of all the properties and revamping the collection system. It is targeted
to provide security of tenure to 37,000 households living in informal settlements who will add to the revenue base. A Municipal Development
Fund
will
be
established as a revolving
fund through the sale of land and other properties for the Municipality to improve infrastructure and provide serviced land on a sustainable basis.



Under Service Delivery,
essential services like water supply, roads, drains and waste management
will be improved specially
targeting low-income areas.

 The overall objective of the project subscribes to the EU guidelines, i.e. to improve the social-political integration of uprooted people as citizens. The specific objective is to provide training, capacity-building and advocacy interventions for local administrations and local parliamentarians to better respond to the needs of uprooted women and IDPs in West Timor.
 
 This objective should be framed with the aim of the Aid to Uprooted People and aims of the concurrent post-conflict programmes within the policies of the Indonesian government. Widespread conflict and displacement affected several regions of Indonesia, including Maluku, Central Sulawesi and West Timor, in the period 1998 and 2002. Healing and integration are still ongoing. In the case of West Timor the violent post-referendum phase in East Timor caused a large influx of pro-Indonesia fighters and sympathizers and their families, and other caught up. The influx took place in areas where traditional community conflicts had simmered for long, and where indigenous communities clashed with new elites, whether military or economic. Many of these local tensions were suppressed during the Suharto era, but erupted (and where often intentionally ignited) as of 1997. The East Timor crisis, however, caused a full blown political displacement crisis in West Timor. 
 
 The Indonesian Government expects that overall policies should now focus on ‘moving ahead’, on sustainable development. Conflict prevention and peace building was written in into national policies. The last National Medium Term Development Programme (2005-2009) called for a ‘safe and peaceful, just and democratic Indonesia with better welfare’. The present five-year plan is more specific, and calls for a special development focus on zones which are least developed, frontier, outer or post-conflict. In NTT, the government states that restitution issues have been dealt with and that peace consolidation is not at the order. Displaced people should become full citizens; they should be part of communities of citizens. 
 
 
    
 The present calls of the EU look for closure as well. The Aid to Uprooted People programme was delivering direct assistance to people affected by conflict and displacement. To phase out, in line with the expectations of the Indonesian Government, it now addresses the last groups of uprooted people which have failed to find for themselves or find assistance from others for a more secure future. These ‘most vulnerable’ are often women, children, female headed households and certain groups of indigenous people (or local people in hosting communities in general) which were also affected by the displacement crisis. The first 2010 call delivered assistance directly to communities. The second call was for improved monitoring and early warning capacity.

land policies, especially in Asia and Africa.
Often it is not possible for these countries to implement pro-poor and gender
sensitive land policies, because the underlying tools and practices do not always
exist, or have not been sufficiently documented and disseminated. Emerging from
the 1990s some organizations and individuals have been trying to address this
issue, but have struggled with the scale of the challenge geographically and
conceptually. In essence, most developing countries use conventional land
administration systems which cover less than 30 percent of the country, leaving
up to 70 percent of citizens looking to informal and/or customary approaches
for their tenure security. 



Prior to GLTN launch in 2006, an analysis was conducted which drew
several important conclusions. First,
while there are many examples of good land policies, there are few policies
that have been fully implemented due to lack of pro-poor, gender-sensitive and
large-scale land tools. Second, a
conclusion was that conventional land titling approaches have largely failed to
deliver their expected results: existing technical solutions are too expensive,
inappropriate for the range of tenure found in developing countries,
unsustainable financially or in terms of available capacity, and instead a
range of land tenure options is more appropriate. Third, an agreement was that land sector work in country cannot be
done at scale successfully in many countries without the combination of various
underlying factors and strategies including better donor coordination,
strengthening partnerships of key land actors, capacity development initiatives
and continuous dialogues and
communications between and amongst key stakeholders including government (at
various levels), professionals, civil society groups, academia/research
institutions, grassroots and target communities themselves. 



To address these
challenges, UN-Habitat has taken the lead and facilitated the establishment of
the Global Land Tool Network that aims at contributing to poverty reduction and
to the achievement of MDGs through the development of pro-poor and gender
sensitive land tools to improve tenure security of the urban and rural poor
since its launch in 2006. GLTN Phase 1 has already achieved significant results
in its 4 years of operations as concluded by the independent mid-term
evaluation and echoed by various partners and land actors. For example, there
is now a growing paradigm shift towards the adoption of a pro-poor, gender
sensitive and large scale land tools, policies and approaches; as well as the
recognition of the need for a ‘continuum of land rights' to replace the more
conventional approaches of reliance on cadastre and individual titles. Global
discourse on key GLTN's tools and approaches are well captured by various
global and regional interventions. Examples include the following: World Bank
is taking the lead in the development of Land Governance and Administration
Framework (LGAF) globally; FAO is taking the lead in the development and implementation
by member-states of the Voluntary Guidelines on Responsible Governance on Tenure of Land, Forests and
Fisheries, wherein UN-Habitat has played a critical role, the adoption of the
African Land Policy Framework and Guidelines which was supported and adopted by
the Third African Ministerial Conference on Housing and Urban Development (AMCHUD)
and the Bamako Action Plan. 



Moreover, Phase 1 has
already developed significant land tools and training packages ready for
rolling out with partners at national and local government levels.
Some partners are already adopting these land tools for their use and for their
capacity development initiatives. For example, the gender evaluation criteria
tool has now been adopted by Huairou Commission for their implementation and training
for trainers (ToTs) will be conducted before the end of the year. Likewise, the
International Land Coalition has indicated that they would like to adopt and
implement the same on their country-level projects in various countries. Training
for land professionals on this tool has also started. As part of GLTN Phase 2,
the gender evaluation criteria will also be introduced and mainstreamed in UN-Habitat
operations particularly in providing in-country support to tool implementation
in targeted countries and/or cities/municipalities and the needed capacity development initiatives
will be undertaken. The Kenya
experience in land policy formulation, donor coordination and engagement with
non-state actors has been used as a model for other country's interventions by
UN-Habitat (e.g. DRC, Eastern Caribbean Island
States, South Sudan and Liberia). GLTN
partners from the academia and training institutions are now adopting the land
tools developed, concepts and training packages in their training and
educational curriculum. For example, ITC-Netherlands is now teaching the
concept and use of the Social Tenure Domain Model (STDM) – a pro-poor land
rights recording system to their Masters' Program while the Technical
University of Munich has been mobilizing resources to adopt some GLTN training
packages for their curriculum as well as for conducting the same training
sessions. GLTN's partnership with grassroots organizations has also yielded
some significant successes. Aside from understanding the underlying reasons why
good grassroots land projects have difficulties in going to scale, specific
experiences like that of Brazil resulted in the regularization of an estimated
55,000 slum dwellers.



While significant results have been achieved by GLTN Phase 1, a great
deal more work is required for gains made to be consolidated and extended. GLTN
Phase 2 will further expand its partnership and scope from its known
international partners to UN-Habitat staff and selected land programmes/projects.
It will also implement some of its priority land tools in targeted countries
and/or cities/municipalities in partnership with UN-Habitat's field projects
and/or international partners with their national and local networks,
particularly in regard to the agencies new priority areas of urban land,
legislations and governance. GLTN Phase 2, in close collaboration with UN-Habitat's
regional offices and field operations, and other partners will ensure that
in-country interventions will be within the framework of ‘One UN System' as
delivering as one and in accordance with the country's Poverty Reduction
Strategy Papers (PRSPs) and/or strategic plans. The key objective is to have
more change agents and champions that have the capacity and knowledge to
promote and implement land policies, tools and approaches that are pro-poor,
gender-sensitive, effective and sustainable to improve tenure security of the urban and rural poor. 



In this context, there is an urgent need and
increasing demand for GLTN to: continue its work; expand its brand and help
develop capacities of its partners (internal and external); and support the adoption
and implementation of pro-poor and gender appropriate land policies, tools and
approaches at national and local government levels through forging strategic
partnerships and piloting and working at country level.

Within the context of the challenges and
innovative approaches described earlier, the GRHS 2009 had identified promising
trends and opportunities for urban planning to be re-established as an
effective tool for the management of human settlement in the 21st
century.

Opportunities exist for incorporating the
informal sector contribution in urban development, for responding to
environmental concerns and to manage the carbon footprint of cities and the
risk and vulnerability to natural disasters and conflicts, while at the same
time ensuring that planning contributes to managing the growth of cities and to
providing shelter for their inhabitants. 

The project will therefore contribute
positively to a new paradigm of urban/regional planning that is proactive,
strategic, flexible, phased, spatially integrated and linked with
municipal-level budgeting and finance systems, to contribute to sustainable
urban development. 

Despite its aspirations, strategic planning is
still regarded as too complex and ineffective. There is still ample room to
make it more appealing, by documenting successes and providing simplified
tools. In this context, it is intended to develop simplified tools and to
continue the revision of existing ones, in order to best incorporate the
principle of sustainability. Attention to the participatory process around
strategic planning will be maintained to ensure its objectives are relevant for
all groups, and particularly the urban poor.

One way to disseminate new approaches will be
via institutions of education. The 2009 GRHS found that, in more than half of
the world’s countries, not a single university offers a degree in urban
planning, whereas even in countries with established planning degrees the
programmes may emphasize the older ‘rational planning’ model with little
attention to current trends and approaches. This programme component will help
to address that gap through partnerships with the international Association of
Planning Schools.

An ultimate form of impact at the normative
level will be achieved through supporting countries in updating their national
urban policies and urban planning frameworks. The 2009 GRHS found that the
planning frameworks in many developing countries still reflect a colonial
legacy; such laws and regulations could be modified to facilitate the
implementation of some of the new urban planning approaches discussed above.
Likewise multi-level planning systems may feature overlapping responsibilities
and lack coherence. UN-Habitat will engage where opportunities will be highest
to influence ongoing reform processes, however, it is aware that achieving
results at this level may well take years, and thus may not lie within the
present programme component timeframe.

Urban planning at the neighbourhood and city
level can play an important role in promoting sustainable urban development and
in contributing to improved quality of life in the community. The project will
pay particular attention to the planning of urban expansions, and mechanisms
for guiding land occupation towards more orderly patterns, with higher
densities and better proportions between built-up and street space and wider
landscape connectivity and ecosystem functionality. 

The project will aim at filling several gaps
at the normative and operational levels, namely gaps in policy development and
analysis, comparative benchmarking, availability of good practices, capacity
within national and local actors, as well as institutionalized mechanisms for
peer learning and other forms of capacity building. 



The project strategy is
developed at 3 levels: 

At global level it will develop tools and
     guidance to support local action, reform and learning, including awareness
     materials, technical tools, documented case studies and analysis of good
     practices. At national level, it will work on national urban
     policies as well as to analyze planning frameworks as a way to identify
     opportunities for introducing innovations and engage in reform processes,
     and will work with key stakeholders for capacity building and awareness. At city level, it will develop pilot activities
     for implementation of planning initiatives and provide expertise on key
     urban planning issues to local governments and other stakeholders groups.

The scope of the Training and Capacity Building Programme aims at addressing five major areas of focus:

Programme management to ensure local stakeholder participation, timely and efficient delivery of programme outputs and an effective monitoring, quality assurance and evaluation system; 
Institutional capacity of service providers to ensure the efficient delivery of water, sanitation and refuse collection and disposal services and the long term sustainability of programme investments. 
Hygiene promotion and sanitation to maximize the public health benefits of the programme, strengthen local structures to manage public sanitation programmes and promote options for financing mechanisms for accessing to household sanitation. 
Urban catchment management to reduce environmental degradation and contribute to the long term sustainability of water resources.
The objective is to provide technical assistance and capacity building component to LVBC in the implementation of the LVWATSAN-II Program. This will be made in order to:

To improve the capacity of the water sector and town level institutions – Ministry of Water organizations, PMU, TPT and MSF, to carry their mandates and responsibilities in support of providing quality water, sanitation and hygiene promotion services. 
To improve the capacity of the water utilities to provide quality and sanitation services through quality management and governance. 
To improve the performance of the water service providers for enhanced quality, reliability and level of water and sanitation services delivery. 
To improve the performance, accountability and transparency in the target towns, through empowering town level institutions, as watchdogs and advocates for equitable and sustainable services delivery. 
To enhance integrated approach to water and sanitation services through support to capacity building to solid waste management, urban planning, urban catchment management, local economic development and promotion of public, and HH hygiene and sanitation.
The Training and Capacity Building Programme will target institutional and human resources capacities at the regional, national and town levels in each of the 5 participating countries. At the national level, capacity building will focus on the Programme Management Units (PMUs) within the Implementing Agencies (IAs). At the town level, the focus will be on the Town Project Teams (TPTs), the Multi-Stake-Holder Forums (MSFs), the service providers and Community-Based Organizations.
The institutional framework for programme management and service delivery is unique to each of the five participating countries. Each country is also undergoing a water sector reform programme which is at various stages of implementation. The design and implementation of the TCB programme will be tailor made to suit the situational context in each country. 
The Implementing Agencyof the Programme in Uganda is the Directorate of Water Development (DWD) in the Ministry of Water and Environment, in Burundi; is Régie de Production et de Distribution de l'Eau et de l'Electricité (REGIDESO), which falls under the Ministry of Energy and Mines (Ministere de l'Energie et des Mines). REGIDESO is a public utility with autonomous legal and financial status and is responsible for service provision in urban areas. In Rwanda will be the Water Supply   Sanitation Sector Co-ordination Unit (WSSSCU) in the Ministry of Infrastructure (MININFRA) which has been instrumental in contributing to the dramatic improvements in service, sustainability and coverage that Rwanda has experienced since sector reforms began in 2000. In Kenya, the Implementing Agency will be the Lake Victoria South Water Services Board (LVSWB) which has an established PMU for the management of projects in the Lake Victoria Basin. In Tanzania, the Implementing Agency will be the Mwanza Urban Water and Sewerage Authority (MWAUWASA) within the Ministry of Water and Irrigation, which has been given the responsibility by the Government of Tanzania to provide technical support to the small towns around Lake Victoria. 
UN-Habitat will be providing both Knowledge services and high-level policy advisory services.

The
proposed project wants to address the problem of water supply shortage in the
county. The poor people of the county are the most victims during shortage of
water supply services. Therefore, the project will target the most vulnerable
groups of the town of Mandera. This is in conformity with the UN Resolution on
Human Rights to Water and sanitation. This resolution was adopted on September
30th 2010 by consensus in the UN Human Rights Council. The resolution recognizes the right to safe
and clean drinking water and sanitation as a human right that is essential for
the full enjoyment of life and all human rights.

Based on the coverage levels
discussed above, the Mandera district has been identified for the intervention.
The project aims to help the settlements in and around the small urban centres
of the county in providing water supply and sanitation services. 



This is to be achieved by
introducing a participatory approach where the beneficiary communities will be
strongly encouraged to establish and implement action plans to address their
problems of water supply and sanitation services. 



There is a strong collaboration
between UN-Habitat and the Members of Parliament of the Mandera County as well
as high officials of the Ministry of State for Development of Northern Kenya
and Other Arid Lands. This partnership between the parties will be an advantage
to secure political will from high officials towards the success of the project
implementation. Therefore, due attention will be given to further strengthen
the collaboration between UN-Habitat and the high officials in the region.



A fast-track project formulation
study and basic assessments of the area will be required. Based on its experience accumulated from several similar projects,
UN-Habitat will assist with the requisite expertise in supporting local water
and sanitation professionals to carry out the work. To ensure sustainability, the
existing institutional framework within the county will form the basis (to be
guided and strengthened with appropriate technical advisory inputs) to
identify, plan and implement the project. 



Steering committees, consisting of
officials from the government organizations, International organizations and
Non-governmental organizations actively participating in the region, at
national and local levels will be formed in order to carry out supervision of
the execution of the project.UN-Habitat is providing both Knowledge services and high level policy advisory services.

The project will address the issue of urban water supply in Hargeisa Town, by increasing the capacity of main water infrastructure components that are currently providing most of the water to the city. It intends to achieve a significant expansion of the safe water supply coverage in Hargeisa, thus contributing to greater accessibility and affordability of water, a lower portion of average household income that is used to gain access to water, improved public health and hygiene, greater volumes of relatively low-cost water available for commercial enterprises and industries, enhanced opportunities for production and employment, and better practices in water catchment protection and environmental conservation. The Project aims at reaching a target group of approximately 900,000 people (the estimated population of Hargeisa at Project inception). 
The specific objectives of the present Project closely match with the Immediate Measures and Short-term Actions of the Hargeisa Water Masterplan[1], which have been identified as the short-term interventions that are urgently required to a) safeguard and augment the existing water supply, and b) to establish the basic preconditions for HWA reorganization and its transition to an efficient public-private partnership. In accordance, the specific objectives of the proposed intervention are to: 
i. Secure supply from Ged Deeble wellfield for the long term, through replacement of the existing rising mains supplying water from the wellfield to the Chinese Reservoir in Hargeisa city; 
ii. Expand and extend the Hargeisa urban water supply system through the rehabilitation and expansion of the Ged Deeble wellfield, and the initial development of the Hora Hadley wellfield, and 
iii. Build capacity at the Hargeisa Water Agency, concentrating on planning, management and delivery of capital works projects.
The overall and specific objectives adopted in the present proposal are based on the Outline Scope of Work for the Project, prepared as a guidance note by the European Commission in January 2012. The overall objective and the first specific objective are identical to the ones mentioned in the guideline document. The second specific objective has been amended and prioritized towards the expansion of Ged Deeble and the development of the Hora Haadley wellfield, in line with the confirmed priorities by local institutional stakeholders, and the available budget. 
As requested, the revised project scope focuses largely on infrastructural developments: consequently, the initial capacity building targets envisaged by the guideline document have been reduced in scope, and are now limited to developing capacities at HWA in the area of planning, management and implementation of infrastructure projects. 
While the prioritization of activities was necessitated by budget limitations, it is felt that the Project should bear in mind some of the original objectives, related to Lot 3 of the Prioritized Construction works towards the Masterplan's Immediate Measures and Short-term Actions. While these objectives cannot be included due to current budget limitations, they should, together with Lot 6 and components of Lot 1 that cannot be covered by the present Project, be the target of ongoing fund-raising efforts by the main stakeholders of the Project (EU, UN-Habitat, and local counterparts). The envisaged additional objectives, which the Project will pursue through active resource mobilization efforts, are:
ii.b Expand the Hargeisa water supply system by completing the rehabilitation and expansion of the Ged Deeble wellfield, and the equipment and connection of the Hora Haadley wellfield
iii.b Build capacity at the Hargeisa Water Agency, in two additional principal areas of the Agency's core duties: (ii) asset management, and (iii) addressing unaccounted water losses and supporting efforts to enhance billing and revenue efficiency. 
iv. Augment and extend the Hargeisa water supply system through expansion and optimisation of the urban distribution network placing a priority on vulnerable households (subject to funding availability)

been moving extremely fast, passing the Rules (a.k.a. By-laws) and Procedures
for both Laws expeditiously and with little consultation with outside groups
(civil society, independent experts, farmers, etc.). The resulting Rules and Procedures are seen
to contain many gaps which the pilots are expected to expose. When that happens, LAMP can propose remedial

UN-Habitat Cities Prosperity Initiative is a strategic policy initiative for
cities and partners that are committed to aligning their policies, operations
and strategies with UN-Habitat's fresh notion of prosperity. Cities are expected to work simultaneously in
the five dimensions of prosperity: productivity, infrastructure, quality of
life, equity and environmental sustainability.




The City Prosperity Initiative is a practical
framework for the formulation, implementation, and monitoring of sustainability
policies and practices to increase prosperity levels at city level. It is an initiative that provides
collaborative solutions to the most fundamental challenges facing cities.



Specifically,
it is an Initiative of 250 cities globally that are committed to a more
holistic, people-centred and sustainable notion of prosperity and pledge to
deploy necessary efforts and resources to move forward in the prosperity path
will be created. The aim is to enable a shift away from prevailing narrow and
lopsided conceptualizations of prosperity and related policies and actions. The
rationale for this is that without a new and revised conceptualization of
prosperity at strategic policy levels, cities risk promoting strategies that
threaten rather than enhance sustainability.



By
estimating the City Prosperity Index (CPI) of cities based on globally
comparable data, UN-Habitat will create an invaluable baseline for tracking
progress in terms of prosperity. In addition, in conducting estimations in
cities through the Initiative, UN-Habitat will also adapt the CPI to correspond
to locally available data, policy priorities and needs. Thus, the Initiative
will enable globally comparable yet locally specific estimation and monitoring
of urban prosperity.



Three intermediate accomplishments of the Cities
Prosperity Initiative will be:

Improved policies and strategies of cities towards prosperity path
     are catalyzed through customised action plans.Cities begin to implement actions and policies to advance on a
     prosperity path based on a customised action plan. Cities have enhanced capacity to measure and monitor present and
     future progress towards the prosperity path.



At a more local level, the Cities
Prosperity Initiative aims at:

Reinforcing local capacities to increase economies of scale and
     agglomeration for improved wellbeing and prosperity through localized
     urban planning and design interventions.Assisting in implementing a variety of technical solutions for
     improving the functionality of the city and achieving sustainable urban
     form.Assisting in packaging projects through pre-feasibility studies and
     project viability for financing.



The benefits of engagement arising from the
Technical Advisory Package offered by UN-Habitat through the Initiative are
captured in the table below.




 
  
  Technical Advisory Package
  UN-Habitat will provide additional
  support to cities for: 
  
  
  
  Benefit
  This will produce:
  
 
 
  
  1.

  Lessons Learned
  
  
 



Following from the above, the expected outputs of the project are as follows:

1.Cities create
conditions to embark on actions and policies to advance in a path of prosperity

2.Cities begin
to implement actions and policies to advance in a path of prosperity based on a
tailored General Action Plan and related Road Map

3.Cities are
capable to monitor, measure and evaluate progress towards the prosperity path

The
City Prosperity Index, together with a conceptual matrix, the Wheel of
Prosperity, both of which are meant to facilitate designing of clear policy
interventions, will form the basis of the technical advisory package described
above. This is accompanied by additional technical support in a wide spectrum
of areas such as institutional analysis, strategic thinking, guidelines,
training and capacity development, monitoring tools, urban futures analysis,
and policy simulations all designed to help cities to advance on the prosperity
path in a more sustainable manner. 



UN-Habitat's
wheel of prosperity symbolizes the well-balanced development of the five
dimensions, the current condition of which is graphically represented in the
City Prosperity Index. The outer rim absorbs the cumulative forces transmitted
through the spokes the five dimensions of prosperity. At the centre is the hub
the local urban power functions, with four interrelated roles: ensuring the
prevalence of public over any other kind of interest; controlling the
direction, pace and momentum of the wheel; ensuring the balanced development of
the five spokes and associated synergies; and in a two-way relationship,
absorbing and amortizing any shocks transmitted by the spokes.







The
hub brings together the power functions (e.g., laws, regulations and
institutions, urban planning, civil society, trade associations, special
agencies, etc.) associated with the five spokes. In this role the hub
represents human agency in all its embodiments. Clearly therefore, the thematic
focus of the project is directly linked to and integrates all of UN-Habitat's
thematic priorities as symbolized by its 7 Branches. The operationalization of
the Cities Prosperity Initiative will involve all Branches of UN-Habitat given
the direct linkages between the five dimensions of the Wheel of Urban
Prosperity (productivity, urban infrastructure, quality of life, equity and
environmental sustainability) and ongoing work in UN-Habitat's thematic
Branches. Once the CPI is estimated for cities, UN-Habitat's Branches
will be fully engaged in the roll out of the Technical Advisory Package (see above)
especially in the diagnosis of prosperity challenges and opportunities to
prepare a general action plan and road map; identification of appropriate
innovative solutions, best practices, tools and guides to facilitate
operationalization of the general action plan and road map; and technical
advisory services to support the establishment of local monitoring mechanisms
to track progress on a path of prosperity. 



In

UN-Habitat Cities Prosperity Initiative is a strategic policy initiative for
cities and partners that are committed to aligning their policies, operations
and strategies with UN-Habitat's fresh notion of prosperity. Cities are expected to work simultaneously in
the five dimensions of prosperity: productivity, infrastructure, quality of
life, equity and environmental sustainability.




The City Prosperity Initiative is a practical
framework for the formulation, implementation, and monitoring of sustainability
policies and practices to increase prosperity levels at city level. It is an initiative that provides
collaborative solutions to the most fundamental challenges facing cities.



Specifically,
it is an Initiative of 250 cities globally that are committed to a more
holistic, people-centred and sustainable notion of prosperity and pledge to
deploy necessary efforts and resources to move forward in the prosperity path
will be created. The aim is to enable a shift away from prevailing narrow and
lopsided conceptualizations of prosperity and related policies and actions. The
rationale for this is that without a new and revised conceptualization of
prosperity at strategic policy levels, cities risk promoting strategies that
threaten rather than enhance sustainability.



By
estimating the City Prosperity Index (CPI) of cities based on globally
comparable data, UN-Habitat will create an invaluable baseline for tracking
progress in terms of prosperity. In addition, in conducting estimations in
cities through the Initiative, UN-Habitat will also adapt the CPI to correspond
to locally available data, policy priorities and needs. Thus, the Initiative
will enable globally comparable yet locally specific estimation and monitoring
of urban prosperity.



Three intermediate accomplishments of the Cities
Prosperity Initiative will be:

Improved policies and strategies of cities towards prosperity path
     are catalyzed through customised action plans.Cities begin to implement actions and policies to advance on a
     prosperity path based on a customised action plan. Cities have enhanced capacity to measure and monitor present and
     future progress towards the prosperity path.



At a more local level, the Cities
Prosperity Initiative aims at:

Reinforcing local capacities to increase economies of scale and
     agglomeration for improved wellbeing and prosperity through localized
     urban planning and design interventions.Assisting in implementing a variety of technical solutions for
     improving the functionality of the city and achieving sustainable urban
     form.Assisting in packaging projects through pre-feasibility studies and
     project viability for financing.



The benefits of engagement arising from the
Technical Advisory Package offered by UN-Habitat through the Initiative are
captured in the table below.




 
  
  Technical Advisory Package
  UN-Habitat will provide additional
  support to cities for: 
  
  
  
  Benefit
  This will produce:
  
 
 
  
  1.

  Lessons Learned
  
  
 



Following from the above, the expected outputs of the project are as follows:

1.Cities create
conditions to embark on actions and policies to advance in a path of prosperity

2.Cities begin
to implement actions and policies to advance in a path of prosperity based on a
tailored General Action Plan and related Road Map

3.Cities are
capable to monitor, measure and evaluate progress towards the prosperity path

The
City Prosperity Index, together with a conceptual matrix, the Wheel of
Prosperity, both of which are meant to facilitate designing of clear policy
interventions, will form the basis of the technical advisory package described
above. This is accompanied by additional technical support in a wide spectrum
of areas such as institutional analysis, strategic thinking, guidelines,
training and capacity development, monitoring tools, urban futures analysis,
and policy simulations all designed to help cities to advance on the prosperity
path in a more sustainable manner. 



UN-Habitat's
wheel of prosperity symbolizes the well-balanced development of the five
dimensions, the current condition of which is graphically represented in the
City Prosperity Index. The outer rim absorbs the cumulative forces transmitted
through the spokes the five dimensions of prosperity. At the centre is the hub
the local urban power functions, with four interrelated roles: ensuring the
prevalence of public over any other kind of interest; controlling the
direction, pace and momentum of the wheel; ensuring the balanced development of
the five spokes and associated synergies; and in a two-way relationship,
absorbing and amortizing any shocks transmitted by the spokes.







The
hub brings together the power functions (e.g., laws, regulations and
institutions, urban planning, civil society, trade associations, special
agencies, etc.) associated with the five spokes. In this role the hub
represents human agency in all its embodiments. Clearly therefore, the thematic
focus of the project is directly linked to and integrates all of UN-Habitat's
thematic priorities as symbolized by its 7 Branches. The operationalization of
the Cities Prosperity Initiative will involve all Branches of UN-Habitat given
the direct linkages between the five dimensions of the Wheel of Urban
Prosperity (productivity, urban infrastructure, quality of life, equity and
environmental sustainability) and ongoing work in UN-Habitat's thematic
Branches. Once the CPI is estimated for cities, UN-Habitat's Branches
will be fully engaged in the roll out of the Technical Advisory Package (see above)
especially in the diagnosis of prosperity challenges and opportunities to
prepare a general action plan and road map; identification of appropriate
innovative solutions, best practices, tools and guides to facilitate
operationalization of the general action plan and road map; and technical
advisory services to support the establishment of local monitoring mechanisms
to track progress on a path of prosperity. 



In
addition, UN-Habitat's regional offices and Habitat Programme Managers will
play a critical role in the operationalization of the Cities Prosperity
Initiative and related activities. Accordingly, using seed funding obtained
from the UN-Habitat Internal Development Fund, the recruitment of three
consultants to be located in UN-Habitat offices in Africa, Asia and Latin
America is already underway.



A
number of external partners will also play a critical role in the realization
of the objectives of the City Prosperity Initiative. These include local and
metropolitan authorities, urban development authorities, local and regional
academic, policy and research institutes, national and regional banks and
Habitat Professionals Associations. Furthermore, where available, UN-Habitat

The purpose of this project is to address four main areas, that
     concur to increased vulnerability to the effects of natural disasters:
     

o
Lack of capacities and structured experiences in
addressing urban risk, reduce risks
and build resilience in cities frequently affected by natural disasters in
Mozambique, Malawi and Madagascar;

o
Lack of capacities of the National Disaster
Institutions to capitalize and
structure the many good practices implemented, which results in huge losses of
resources

o
Lack of harmonized practices at the regional level and low level of mutual learning among countries that
share the same hazards and risks

o
Weak capacities of communities in human settlements in
Mozambique to build safely and
rebuild with improvement or retrofitting better houses and community
infrastructure (i.e. schools). The focus on Mozambique for this aspect is due
to a direct request of ECHO, in response to cyclone Funso that affected
Mozambique in 2012.

UN-Habitat, in partnership with other UN agencies (and in
     particular FAO), is well placed to contribute in addressing the causes of
     the problems, thanks to 10 years of experience in DRR in the sub-region,
     established partnership and reputations at regional level via the upcoming
     DIMSUR Centre and presence in the 3 main countries of the action. It will:

o
develop the first
innovative Urban Risk and Resilience instrument in the sub-region, by engaging
experts, local governments and partners in the elaboration of the tool and in
its testing at city-level

o
document all
shelter, housing and infrastructure resistant practices hand-in-hand with the National
Institutions, so to publish do's and don'ts, which might be turned into
National Policies

o
provide technical
assistance and support data management to all DRR partners in its field of
expertise (Housing and Shelter; Land Tenure; Planning)

o
rebuild as
on-the-job training at least 15 community schools and 50 houses, hand-in-hand
with INGC and Ministry of Public Works to document the practice and include it
in the Disaster Contingency Planning of Mozambique



All priorities
have been established (Ref. assessments) along with the 4 categories of
beneficiaries this projects benefits, as detailed below



Given the
complexity of this context the problem can only by addressed by a broad
partnership of international actors, along with national to local authorities.
For this reason a technical partnership has been established, through the
DIPECHO III project at regional level among UN-Habitat, FAO, CARE and COOPI and
at national level in the 3 countries with a number of partnering UN agencies,
NGOs and the Red Cross. Then, this project has been designed in parallel with 3
other projects designed by FAO, CARE and COOPI in respective areas of
expertise, with a common overall logical framework and same areas of
intervention. 



Within this
partnership, UN-Habitat will provide high-level policy advisory services, along
with technical support and direct implementation to all categories of
beneficiaries and to its partners.



The purpose of
this project will therefore be to:Ensuring the
capitalization along with National to Local authorities in the 3 countries of
DRR/M practices on Housing and Basic Community Infrastructure resistant to
Disaster, so to take stock and transform practices into policies. (In common
log-frame with FAO, COOPI, CARE); IMPORTANT:

According to statistics of IOM from October 2012, the number of returnees between October 2010 and October 2012 in Western Bahr el Ghazal, Upper Nile and Central Equatoria was 197,027 with continued new arrivals every day. A fast horizontal sprawling of state capitals and major towns is observed, with low income groups settling in urban and peri-urban areas and provoking slum formation. The debate in South Sudan is whether it is better for the returnees to go back to their original villages where they can access land for agriculture, or to settle in urban areas where they can access basic services and job opportunities. Although it is understood that returnees should make their choice freely, humanitarian organisations should not forget the high social cost of recent mass evictions and demolition campaigns in informal urban areas nor underestimate the critical importance of designing long term spatial development mechanisms and capacities in the short term to prevent potential conflict and to contribute to peace stabilisation. Therefore, a proactive approach is needed to ensure a more sustainable returnee reintegration process and prevent slum formation through application of provision of adequate housing conditions and basic services, establishment of livelihood options for returnees and equitable and planned land allocation. It is suggested to start working in the states with high numbers of returnees to build basic institutional capacities through on-the-job training and implementation of demonstration activities. While targeted direct beneficiaries of this project are returnees and host communities, the main project counterparts of UN-Habitat will be the Ministry of Housing and Physical Planning (MHPP) of the government of South Sudan (GoSS) and the Ministries of Physical Infrastructure (MoPIs) of the three targeted states.
Through this initiative UN-Habitat will provide adequate housing conditions and basic community infrastructure through participatory approach and on-the-job institutional capacity building, set an example and develop strategies for national housing delivery and urban planning for replication and scaling up and promote the use of low-cost and environmental-friendly construction techniques which can also sustain livelihoods and support urban and regional planning and land management. This will be done in close coordination with GoSS as well as other UN agencies and international bi/multilateral partners working on return and reintegration issues.
Although construction of permanent housing, support to sustainable livelihood and planning are often considered to be development activities, in context of South Sudan, where thousands have already returned and need support to settle and re-integrate in existing urban areas, quickly for sake of human security and prevention of new conflicts in this still very vulnerable country which has its internal issues with negative potentials, this project has a clear emergency character. The project is designed for a quick and measurable impact: provide houses, support livelihoods and reintegration within host communities in a planned manner. Planning and capacity building of government authorities is included through a form of on-the-job trainings which would create conditions for construction and reintegration in planned settlements and lay the foundation and an example for continued reintegration process.

The FP7call text has identified several regions in the world, policy areas and previous and on-going projects relevant for addressing the topic: “Implementing innovative and green urban transport solutions in Europe and beyond (SST.2013.3-2).” SOLUTIONS will address all regions and policy areas addressed, and will link into all projects mentioned in the call text. This integrated approach will develop the greatest synergies, which will be for the benefit of all participating cities SOLUTIONS will link to and build upon. 
Europe, China, Singapore and Latin America have developed a wide range of innovative sustainable mobility solutions, technologies and innovations and the SOLUTIONS project will bring these experiences together and will facilitate dialogue and knowledge sharing, foster uptake and innovation transfer and support future targeted cooperation. SOLUTIONS will achieve this, by using a four-step approach[TS1], which also mirrors the work package structure of the project. An initial transferability assessment of research and technology and innovation supported in past or on-going EU funded collaborative research and cooperation projects will summarize the existing knowledge on state of art innovative and sustainable urban mobility solutions and experience with their transferability to different local and regional contexts. This will be complemented by experience and solutions (technologies and best practices in each context) from leading cities from Europe, China and Latin America and from Singapore. The first set of agreed guidelines for transferability will be a key input to the knowledge sharing and capacity building platform, which will be the second step towards the promotion of take-up of sustainable urban mobility and transport solutions. 
These two steps will have cross-links with the global dialogue and will provide the opportunity to work with cities that are capable and motivated to take the next step towards implementation: the needs assessment and the feasibility studies for Asian and Latin American cities or the needs assessment and development of recommendations for the Mediterranean. The experiences from these cities will then feed back into transferability (technology, practices) guidelines, which will later provide a comprehensive “handbook” of experience with selected innovative sustainable urban mobility and transport solutions around the world. The results that will be obtained will be promoted widely in the partner regions and globally to accelerate the deployment of innovative and sustainable urban mobility solutions in cities in Europe and around the world.
While SOLUTIONS will build strongly on previous and on-going projects and coordination initiatives, as is the nature of a coordinating action, it also aims to provide added value that goes beyond summarising and facilitating knowledge sharing and research and technology transfer. SOLUTIONS aims to bridge the “implementation gap” between the potentials of innovative sustainable mobility and transport solutions and packages of solutions and the actual level of uptake and quality of the deployment and implementation mechanisms.
Through its outlined objectives, the SOLUTIONS project will specifically address the problem of a lack of broad regional up-take of innovative urban mobility solutions which have been successful particularly in Europe, China, Singapore and Latin America. 

The core target group for the SOLUTIONS project are cities, for which the project has three categories to support the take-up of sustainable urban mobility solutions:
Leading Cities
Leading Cities from Europe, China, Latin America, and Singapore, can share their expertise in the development and implementation of sustainable urban mobility solutions. They will also benefit from the mutual learning process and the knowledge sharing with other cities in the world.
Take-up Cities
The feasibility studies developed in WP3 will be a concrete step toward implementation of innovative sustainable urban mobility solutions in Asia and Latin America and provides showcases for other cities around the world.
Learning Cities
The trainings offered in WP2 and the transferability guidelines will provide active support for cities to implement sustainable urban mobility solutions and the knowledge sharing and dialogue will inform the identification of future research needs.

The regions addressed in this project present different levels of maturity in terms of experience with sustainable urban mobility related actions.

Four SOLUTIONS regions with different approaches:

Europe: Leading Cities in development and implementation of sustainable urban mobility 
Asia: Regions of particular interest: electromobility, public transport and Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) 
Latin America: Regions of particular interest: Bus Rapid Transit and modal integration in public transport 
Mediterranean: Knowledge sharing and identification of future research needs, focus on: Public Transport, Transport infrastructure, City logistics and Integrated planning/SUMPs
Using the above regions and allocated approaches, the SOLUTIONS project aims to deploy innovative sustainable transport solutions in Europe and across the world to address global challenges.
The principle tools for achieving this are:

Identify key innovations, examine transferability, webinars 
Feasibility studies, knowledge sharing, developing projects 
Global dialogue among policy makers and practitioners from Europa, Asia, Latin America and the Mediterranean International conference, fostering thematic dialogues, capacity building, recommendations for future cooperation 
Research cooperation with Mediterranean partner countries 
Knowledge exchange, policy recommendations, research cooperation
An overview of the approach to address the Problem encompassing all work-package elements is described below: 

1. Deployment of innovative sustainable transport solutions in Europe and across the world to address global challenges thorough a review and assessment of existing innovative transport solutions in Europe, Asia and Latin America. 
Innovative transport solutions that have been successfully implemented mainly in Europe but also in Asia and Latin America, leading to significant benefits for various stakeholders, will be identified and thoroughly analysed, utilizing the past experience of the project partners and of the network of associated entities on relevant initiatives. In addition to focusing on European innovations, innovative transport solutions implemented in Asia and Latin America will be also assessed in terms of their applicability to European cities.
Transferability analysis 
The innovative transport solutions from Europe, Asia and Latin America will be analysed in detail assessing their transferability potential to cities located in the target world regions (Europe, Asia, Latin America and Mediterranean) (WP 1). The analysis will take into account specific socio-economic, environmental and political conditions in the target regions enabling the summary of the key characteristics of cities in those regions. Therefore, for each measure or package of measures, the specific context and settings that must apply for their successful transferability will be identified and compared to the existing conditions in the partner regions enabling the identification of the specific steps that need to be taken towards their successful adoption by the local stakeholders in each case. A collection of transferable policies and measures for each region will be effectively disseminated.
Providing information on success factors and barriers to existing innovative transport solutions 
Utilizing past experience derived from the successful application of innovative transport solutions in Europe, the transferability analysis will identify success factors as well as barriers for their take-up and implementation (WP 1). Guidance on the implementation processes will be provided with examples from Europe, China, Singapore and Latin America. SOLUTIONS thus will support cities throughout the process of selecting and implementing new transport solutions avoiding in that way any potential mistakes and accelerating decision-making. 
Knowledge sharing on transferable innovative transport solutions 
Results of the detailed analysis of the innovative transport solutions will be disseminated in the form of publications and through regional workshops in the Mediterranean, Asia and Latin America (WP 2). Knowledge sharing regarding the identified new transport solutions is the first important step towards a broader deployment of these innovative approaches. SOLUTIONS will provide take-up candidates with fast and easy access regarding the implementation experiences derived from European cases, thus accelerating implementation in other cities.
Feasibility studies in Asian and Latin American partner cities
SOLUTIONS will go beyond the theoretical analysis of the best practices, by testing the feasibility of selected innovative transport solutions in four showcase cities (WP 3). The feasibility studies will assess whether the proposed measures are feasible within the existing policy environment, technically and financially. The feasibility studies will ensure that partner cities can identify and select measures that are the most suitable for their local conditions maximizing their potential impact and leading to significant benefits. To this end, the feasibility of selected approaches proves to be an additional key step towards the successful deployment of new transport solutions. The outcome of the feasibility study will be a validated transport solution that can be successfully implemented by the city representatives. 
Attractive transport solutions for cities in Asia and Latin America
To meet the specific needs of different cities; the participating cities will be asked to indicate the innovative transport solutions they are interested in. The outcomes of the initial transferability analysis will enable the partner cities to select measures that are desirable from their perspective (WP 3) within a specific thematic cluster or cross cutting among several clusters. Developing targeted projects 
SOLUTIONS will prepare the deployment of innovative transport solutions up to the initiation of the actual implementation process. For four cities two in each of Asia and Latin America, detailed policy recommendations and targeted projects will be developed based on the feasibility studies (WP 3). The costs and benefits of selected measures will be assessed and specific project proposals will be developed including recommendations on possible sources of funding such as climate finance options, etc. 
Dissemination of the knowledge gained regarding the transferability of innovative green transport solutions
The experiences shared in cooperation with the partner cities will provide significant input in the form of specific guidelines that will support interested cities throughout the deployment of innovative green transport solutions worldwide. Thereby, the local deployment of selected solutions in the partner cities will act as a role model for deployment worldwide. In this process the consortium members will play an important role as multipliers.
Guidelines for assessing the transferability of innovative transport solutions and for conducting feasibility studies will be developed and disseminated using the broad network of the consortium members (WP 1 / WP 2 / WP 4 / WP 5). The guidelines will include easy-to-use tools that can be easily applied by policy practitioners in emerging countries. Furthermore, finance guidelines and guidelines on institutions and governance will be compiled and disseminated to assist practitioners in the implementation process. 


2. Transfer of innovative transport solutions promoted by European industry to other regions of the world

Identifying key transport innovations developed by European companies and testing their transferability
The transferability guidelines will include two aspects policy innovation and technology solutions promoted by European industry. SOLUTIONS will outline the potential of innovative technology solutions and define ways to integrate them into existing systems and structures (WP 1). 
Providing information on the transferability of innovative transport solutions
SOLUTIONS will analyse different transport solutions with regard to their transferability to specific regional conditions around the world (WP 1). The analysis will also include transport solutions that are based on products of European industry. Conditions under which the specific measure or package of measures can be applied with a comparable degree of success elsewhere will be identified. Issues affecting the implementation process or the outcomes of the measures such as legal and political frameworks, public acceptance, enforcement and technological requirements will be analysed. Necessary adjustments to the measures will be identified and fed back to European industry, thus ensuring their applicability in other regions. 
Webinars providing information on solutions promoted by European industry
A series of webinars will be offered to cities in the target regions as well as to officials from cities around the world (WP 2). During the webinars, information on innovative green transport solutions promoted by European industry will be provided broadening their visibility in several cities worldwide.
3. Global dialogue among policy makers and practitioners from Europe, Asia, Latin America and the Mediterranean
International conference with participants from all regions
All participants (project partners and network of associated entities) from Latin America, Asia, the Mediterranean and Europe will come together in an international conference to discuss available transport solutions and existing experiences (WP 2). 
Side events at major international conferences 
As part of the project, side events at major international conferences such as the World Urban Forum, UN-Habitat Governing Council and the International Transport Forum will be organised (WP 5). During these side events, policy makers, practitioners and international experts will have the opportunity to discuss transport innovation and while first results of the transferability analysis will be presented. 
Fostering thematic dialogues 
Policy makers, practitioners and experts from various thematic clusters will come together in order to discuss transport innovations in the field of policy technology and infrastructure as well as further on-going research. The project consortium will bring together policy experts, transferability experts, feasibility experts and implementation partners facilitating their fruitful dialogue. The dialogue will be encouraged by face-to-face meetings in the form of three workshops taking place in Asia, Latin America and the Mediterranean (WP 2 / WP 5). Eight to twelve cities per region are expected to participate in those workshops and be closely involved in the thematic dialogues. 
Close cooperation between local practitioners from different regions – Mutual learning
SOLUTIONS will bring together local practitioners and policy makers from different regions across the world (WP 3 / WP 4), establishing close cooperation and an efficient knowledge transfer channel between cities that have successfully implemented transport innovations and cities that are interested in adopting a similar approach. Thereby, SOLUTIONS will strengthen the links between local authorities in Europe and in other industrialised or emerging countries while the process of mutual learning will further support global dialogue.
Capacity building 
The knowledge gained through SOLUTIONS regarding innovative green transport solutions and their transferability, will greatly support existing workshops and training programmes in Asia, Latin America and the Mediterranean (WP 2). Those events will provide the opportunity to local practitioners to be efficiently trained regarding the transferability and feasibility analysis of transport solutions and be informed in detail about implementation examples in Europe and/or the partner countries. 
Online exchange platform, information gateway and materials
A public SOLUTIONS website will be developed. The website will be the main tool for communication and exchange of information. It will act as the promotional portal for SOLUTIONS and will offer tailored information for the different target groups. The website will be structured to provide easily accessible information for practitioners, city officials, national governments or ministries and international organisations. The website will foster cross regional knowledge sharing and dialogue not only within one target group, but its design is intended to trigger discussions across the various groups of stakeholders. The website will be promoted through an online newsletter that will be spread with the help of the networking and dissemination partners. SOLUTIONS will also use social media applications such as Facebook and Twitter to stimulate a global dialogue on innovative transport solutions and to facilitate exchange. 
Multiplier workshops
Key results of SOLUTIONS will be presented at multiplier workshops. The workshops will raise the profile of the SOLUTIONS projects and will promote the innovative solutions that have been assessed. Moreover, the workshops will bring together stakeholders from various regions and will trigger a discussion about innovative solutions. The workshops will be linked to related events and conferences and each will be carried out in a different region to optimise outreach. 
Developing recommendations for future cooperation 
Based on the experience gained during the course of the project, detailed recommendations for future cooperation between the focus regions, with regard to transport solutions, will be developed. The experiences gained and the research gaps identified during the transferability and feasibility studies as well as the initial implementation efforts will foster the development of a future research cooperation agenda for Asia and Latin America (WP 3) as well as for the Mediterranean (WP 4).
4. Research cooperation with Mediterranean partner countries
Knowledge exchange on innovative green transport solutions
Mutual exchange of experience on innovative green urban transport solutions will be fostered through workshops, the international conference and additional bilateral meetings that will be organized (WP 2 / WP 5). During these events researchers will identify those solutions of interest to specific areas and will set the agenda for further investigating them and evaluating their potential within the context of local conditions. 
Analysis of the current situation in the Mediterranean
SOLUTIONS will analyse the current situation of the transport system in Mediterranean cities (several city and national authorities from the region have provided Letters of Support) as well as the framework conditions prevailing there (WP 4). The assessment of local conditions in each city will enable the identification of those solutions fitting best local needs and presenting the highest transferability potential. Furthermore, current gaps in Mediterranean urban transport systems as well as related research gaps will be identified.

Formulation of policy recommendations
Bases on the gap analysis, policy recommendations for Mediterranean cities will be formulated (WP 4). During the transferability studies, innovative transport solutions will be tested with regard to their transferability to the specific conditions existing on Mediterranean cities. As a result, a set of measures that are transferable to Mediterranean cities will be included in the policy recommendations. 

Mediterranean urban mobility research network
SOLUTIONS will foster the development of a Euro-Mediterranean urban mobility research network (WP 4). The network will be developed based on the vast number of activities carried out in SOLUTIONS that enable face-to-face encounters between researchers and practitioners. 

Development of a research cooperation agenda for the Mediterranean
SOLUTIONS will develop a research cooperation agenda on sustainable urban transport. The research agenda will be based on the identified research gaps (WP 4). As the agenda will build on discussions with researchers and local stakeholders during SOLUTIONS, it is ensured that it includes the actual needs of local practitioners. In addition, the research agenda outlines opportunities for initiating future research cooperation between Europe and other Mediterranean countries

The FP7call text has identified several regions in the world, policy areas and previous and on-going projects relevant for addressing the topic: “Implementing innovative and green urban transport solutions in Europe and beyond (SST.2013.3-2).” SOLUTIONS will address all regions and policy areas addressed, and will link into all projects mentioned in the call text. This integrated approach will develop the greatest synergies, which will be for the benefit of all participating cities SOLUTIONS will link to and build upon. 
Europe, China, Singapore and Latin America have developed a wide range of innovative sustainable mobility solutions, technologies and innovations and the SOLUTIONS project will bring these experiences together and will facilitate dialogue and knowledge sharing, foster uptake and innovation transfer and support future targeted cooperation. SOLUTIONS will achieve this, by using a four-step approach[TS1], which also mirrors the work package structure of the project. An initial transferability assessment of research and technology and innovation supported in past or on-going EU funded collaborative research and cooperation projects will summarize the existing knowledge on state of art innovative and sustainable urban mobility solutions and experience with their transferability to different local and regional contexts. This will be complemented by experience and solutions (technologies and best practices in each context) from leading cities from Europe, China and Latin America and from Singapore. The first set of agreed guidelines for transferability will be a key input to the knowledge sharing and capacity building platform, which will be the second step towards the promotion of take-up of sustainable urban mobility and transport solutions. 
These two steps will have cross-links with the global dialogue and will provide the opportunity to work with cities that are capable and motivated to take the next step towards implementation: the needs assessment and the feasibility studies for Asian and Latin American cities or the needs assessment and development of recommendations for the Mediterranean. The experiences from these cities will then feed back into transferability (technology, practices) guidelines, which will later provide a comprehensive “handbook” of experience with selected innovative sustainable urban mobility and transport solutions around the world. The results that will be obtained will be promoted widely in the partner regions and globally to accelerate the deployment of innovative and sustainable urban mobility solutions in cities in Europe and around the world.
While SOLUTIONS will build strongly on previous and on-going projects and coordination initiatives, as is the nature of a coordinating action, it also aims to provide added value that goes beyond summarising and facilitating knowledge sharing and research and technology transfer. SOLUTIONS aims to bridge the “implementation gap” between the potentials of innovative sustainable mobility and transport solutions and packages of solutions and the actual level of uptake and quality of the deployment and implementation mechanisms.
Through its outlined objectives, the SOLUTIONS project will specifically address the problem of a lack of broad regional up-take of innovative urban mobility solutions which have been successful particularly in Europe, China, Singapore and Latin America. 

The core target group for the SOLUTIONS project are cities, for which the project has three categories to support the take-up of sustainable urban mobility solutions:
Leading Cities
Leading Cities from Europe, China, Latin America, and Singapore, can share their expertise in the development and implementation of sustainable urban mobility solutions. They will also benefit from the mutual learning process and the knowledge sharing with other cities in the world.
Take-up Cities
The feasibility studies developed in WP3 will be a concrete step toward implementation of innovative sustainable urban mobility solutions in Asia and Latin America and provides showcases for other cities around the world.
Learning Cities
The trainings offered in WP2 and the transferability guidelines will provide active support for cities to implement sustainable urban mobility solutions and the knowledge sharing and dialogue will inform the identification of future research needs.

The regions addressed in this project present different levels of maturity in terms of experience with sustainable urban mobility related actions.

Four SOLUTIONS regions with different approaches:

Europe: Leading Cities in development and implementation of sustainable urban mobility 
Asia: Regions of particular interest: electromobility, public transport and Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) 
Latin America: Regions of particular interest: Bus Rapid Transit and modal integration in public transport 
Mediterranean: Knowledge sharing and identification of future research needs, focus on: Public Transport, Transport infrastructure, City logistics and Integrated planning/SUMPs
Using the above regions and allocated approaches, the SOLUTIONS project aims to deploy innovative sustainable transport solutions in Europe and across the world to address global challenges.
The principle tools for achieving this are:

Identify key innovations, examine transferability, webinars 
Feasibility studies, knowledge sharing, developing projects 
Global dialogue among policy makers and practitioners from Europa, Asia, Latin America and the Mediterranean International conference, fostering thematic dialogues, capacity building, recommendations for future cooperation 
Research cooperation with Mediterranean partner countries 
Knowledge exchange, policy recommendations, research cooperation
An overview of the approach to address the Problem encompassing all work-package elements is described below: 

1. Deployment of innovative sustainable transport solutions in Europe and across the world to address global challenges thorough a review and assessment of existing innovative transport solutions in Europe, Asia and Latin America. 
Innovative transport solutions that have been successfully implemented mainly in Europe but also in Asia and Latin America, leading to significant benefits for various stakeholders, will be identified and thoroughly analysed, utilizing the past experience of the project partners and of the network of associated entities on relevant initiatives. In addition to focusing on European innovations, innovative transport solutions implemented in Asia and Latin America will be also assessed in terms of their applicability to European cities.
Transferability analysis 
The innovative transport solutions from Europe, Asia and Latin America will be analysed in detail assessing their transferability potential to cities located in the target world regions (Europe, Asia, Latin America and Mediterranean) (WP 1). The analysis will take into account specific socio-economic, environmental and political conditions in the target regions enabling the summary of the key characteristics of cities in those regions. Therefore, for each measure or package of measures, the specific context and settings that must apply for their successful transferability will be identified and compared to the existing conditions in the partner regions enabling the identification of the specific steps that need to be taken towards their successful adoption by the local stakeholders in each case. A collection of transferable policies and measures for each region will be effectively disseminated.
Providing information on success factors and barriers to existing innovative transport solutions 
Utilizing past experience derived from the successful application of innovative transport solutions in Europe, the transferability analysis will identify success factors as well as barriers for their take-up and implementation (WP 1). Guidance on the implementation processes will be provided with examples from Europe, China, Singapore and Latin America. SOLUTIONS thus will support cities throughout the process of selecting and implementing new transport solutions avoiding in that way any potential mistakes and accelerating decision-making. 
Knowledge sharing on transferable innovative transport solutions 
Results of the detailed analysis of the innovative transport solutions will be disseminated in the form of publications and through regional workshops in the Mediterranean, Asia and Latin America (WP 2). Knowledge sharing regarding the identified new transport solutions is the first important step towards a broader deployment of these innovative approaches. SOLUTIONS will provide take-up candidates with fast and easy access regarding the implementation experiences derived from European cases, thus accelerating implementation in other cities.
Feasibility studies in Asian and Latin American partner cities
SOLUTIONS will go beyond the theoretical analysis of the best practices, by testing the feasibility of selected innovative transport solutions in four showcase cities (WP 3). The feasibility studies will assess whether the proposed measures are feasible within the existing policy environment, technically and financially. The feasibility studies will ensure that partner cities can identify and select measures that are the most suitable for their local conditions maximizing their potential impact and leading to significant benefits. To this end, the feasibility of selected approaches proves to be an additional key step towards the successful deployment of new transport solutions. The outcome of the feasibility study will be a validated transport solution that can be successfully implemented by the city representatives. 
Attractive transport solutions for cities in Asia and Latin America
To meet the specific needs of different cities; the participating cities will be asked to indicate the innovative transport solutions they are interested in. The outcomes of the initial transferability analysis will enable the partner cities to select measures that are desirable from their perspective (WP 3) within a specific thematic cluster or cross cutting among several clusters. Developing targeted projects 
SOLUTIONS will prepare the deployment of innovative transport solutions up to the initiation of the actual implementation process. For four cities two in each of Asia and Latin America, detailed policy recommendations and targeted projects will be developed based on the feasibility studies (WP 3). The costs and benefits of selected measures will be assessed and specific project proposals will be developed including recommendations on possible sources of funding such as climate finance options, etc. 
Dissemination of the knowledge gained regarding the transferability of innovative green transport solutions
The experiences shared in cooperation with the partner cities will provide significant input in the form of specific guidelines that will support interested cities throughout the deployment of innovative green transport solutions worldwide. Thereby, the local deployment of selected solutions in the partner cities will act as a role model for deployment worldwide. In this process the consortium members will play an important role as multipliers.
Guidelines for assessing the transferability of innovative transport solutions and for conducting feasibility studies will be developed and disseminated using the broad network of the consortium members (WP 1 / WP 2 / WP 4 / WP 5). The guidelines will include easy-to-use tools that can be easily applied by policy practitioners in emerging countries. Furthermore, finance guidelines and guidelines on institutions and governance will be compiled and disseminated to assist practitioners in the implementation process. 


2. Transfer of innovative transport solutions promoted by European industry to other regions of the world

Identifying key transport innovations developed by European companies and testing their transferability
The transferability guidelines will include two aspects policy innovation and technology solutions promoted by European industry. SOLUTIONS will outline the potential of innovative technology solutions and define ways to integrate them into existing systems and structures (WP 1). 
Providing information on the transferability of innovative transport solutions
SOLUTIONS will analyse different transport solutions with regard to their transferability to specific regional conditions around the world (WP 1). The analysis will also include transport solutions that are based on products of European industry. Conditions under which the specific measure or package of measures can be applied with a comparable degree of success elsewhere will be identified. Issues affecting the implementation process or the outcomes of the measures such as legal and political frameworks, public acceptance, enforcement and technological requirements will be analysed. Necessary adjustments to the measures will be identified and fed back to European industry, thus ensuring their applicability in other regions. 
Webinars providing information on solutions promoted by European industry
A series of webinars will be offered to cities in the target regions as well as to officials from cities around the world (WP 2). During the webinars, information on innovative green transport solutions promoted by European industry will be provided broadening their visibility in several cities worldwide.
3. Global dialogue among policy makers and practitioners from Europe, Asia, Latin America and the Mediterranean
International conference with participants from all regions
All participants (project partners and network of associated entities) from Latin America, Asia, the Mediterranean and Europe will come together in an international conference to discuss available transport solutions and existing experiences (WP 2). 
Side events at major international conferences 
As part of the project, side events at major international conferences such as the World Urban Forum, UN-Habitat Governing Council and the International Transport Forum will be organised (WP 5). During these side events, policy makers, practitioners and international experts will have the opportunity to discuss transport innovation and while first results of the transferability analysis will be presented. 
Fostering thematic dialogues 
Policy makers, practitioners and experts from various thematic clusters will come together in order to discuss transport innovations in the field of policy technology and infrastructure as well as further on-going research. The project consortium will bring together policy experts, transferability experts, feasibility experts and implementation partners facilitating their fruitful dialogue. The dialogue will be encouraged by face-to-face meetings in the form of three workshops taking place in Asia, Latin America and the Mediterranean (WP 2 / WP 5). Eight to twelve cities per region are expected to participate in those workshops and be closely involved in the thematic dialogues. 
Close cooperation between local practitioners from different regions – Mutual learning
SOLUTIONS will bring together local practitioners and policy makers from different regions across the world (WP 3 / WP 4), establishing close cooperation and an efficient knowledge transfer channel between cities that have successfully implemented transport innovations and cities that are interested in adopting a similar approach. Thereby, SOLUTIONS will strengthen the links between local authorities in Europe and in other industrialised or emerging countries while the process of mutual learning will further support global dialogue.
Capacity building 
The knowledge gained through SOLUTIONS regarding innovative green transport solutions and their transferability, will greatly support existing workshops and training programmes in Asia, Latin America and the Mediterranean (WP 2). Those events will provide the opportunity to local practitioners to be efficiently trained regarding the transferability and feasibility analysis of transport solutions and be informed in detail about implementation examples in Europe and/or the partner countries. 
Online exchange platform, information gateway and materials
A public SOLUTIONS website will be developed. The website will be the main tool for communication and exchange of information. It will act as the promotional portal for SOLUTIONS and will offer tailored information for the different target groups. The website will be structured to provide easily accessible information for practitioners, city officials, national governments or ministries and international organisations. The website will foster cross regional knowledge sharing and dialogue not only within one target group, but its design is intended to trigger discussions across the various groups of stakeholders. The website will be promoted through an online newsletter that will be spread with the help of the networking and dissemination partners. SOLUTIONS will also use social media applications such as Facebook and Twitter to stimulate a global dialogue on innovative transport solutions and to facilitate exchange. 
Multiplier workshops
Key results of SOLUTIONS will be presented at multiplier workshops. The workshops will raise the profile of the SOLUTIONS projects and will promote the innovative solutions that have been assessed. Moreover, the workshops will bring together stakeholders from various regions and will trigger a discussion about innovative solutions. The workshops will be linked to related events and conferences and each will be carried out in a different region to optimise outreach. 
Developing recommendations for future cooperation 
Based on the experience gained during the course of the project, detailed recommendations for future cooperation between the focus regions, with regard to transport solutions, will be developed. The experiences gained and the research gaps identified during the transferability and feasibility studies as well as the initial implementation efforts will foster the development of a future research cooperation agenda for Asia and Latin America (WP 3) as well as for the Mediterranean (WP 4).
4. Research cooperation with Mediterranean partner countries
Knowledge exchange on innovative green transport solutions
Mutual exchange of experience on innovative green urban transport solutions will be fostered through workshops, the international conference and additional bilateral meetings that will be organized (WP 2 / WP 5). During these events researchers will identify those solutions of interest to specific areas and will set the agenda for further investigating them and evaluating their potential within the context of local conditions. 
Analysis of the current situation in the Mediterranean
SOLUTIONS will analyse the current situation of the transport system in Mediterranean cities (several city and national authorities from the region have provided Letters of Support) as well as the framework conditions prevailing there (WP 4). The assessment of local conditions in each city will enable the identification of those solutions fitting best local needs and presenting the highest transferability potential. Furthermore, current gaps in Mediterranean urban transport systems as well as related research gaps will be identified.

Formulation of policy recommendations
Bases on the gap analysis, policy recommendations for Mediterranean cities will be formulated (WP 4). During the transferability studies, innovative transport solutions will be tested with regard to their transferability to the specific conditions existing on Mediterranean cities. As a result, a set of measures that are transferable to Mediterranean cities will be included in the policy recommendations. 

Mediterranean urban mobility research network
SOLUTIONS will foster the development of a Euro-Mediterranean urban mobility research network (WP 4). The network will be developed based on the vast number of activities carried out in SOLUTIONS that enable face-to-face encounters between researchers and practitioners. 

Development of a research cooperation agenda for the Mediterranean
SOLUTIONS will develop a research cooperation agenda on sustainable urban transport. The research agenda will be based on the identified research gaps (WP 4). As the agenda will build on discussions with researchers and local stakeholders during SOLUTIONS, it is ensured that it includes the actual needs of local practitioners. In addition, the research agenda outlines opportunities for initiating future research cooperation between Europe and other Mediterranean countries

The overall objective of JPGL II is to promote
improvements in local governance quality that can contribute to peace
consolidation, development and equitable service delivery. For JPLG's overall
objective to be realised, a number of agents
will have to
promote change that
can alter the
status quo in
a direction that
fosters a stronger, more
responsive and accountable
compact between the
state and its
citizens in the
provision of service delivery.
Despite progress the
current context is
still characterised by
limited trust in
government structures at both central and local levels, which in turn
means that their legitimacy is often contested.
This can increase the
risk of a
return to instability
and conflict. Moreover, the political space is still limited especially in southern areas, where
radical groups restrict the voice of many, including women. There is thus
a need
to consolidate and
enlarge the space
for non-state actors
in the rest
of Somalia and
to restore a healthy and accountable state citizen
nexus. 



To achieve the overall objective of JPLG II, the
programme outcomes are structured around three mutually reinforcing
strategies: 



1. Supporting policy and legislative reforms for
functional, fiscal and administrative decentralization that clarify and enhance
the role of local government, its relationship to central government, and as a
means to improve local service delivery.



Outcome 1 will focus on policy
and legal frameworks across Somalia
and is initially designed to address weaknesses in current laws on
decentralization in Somaliland and
Puntland. These provide an incomplete
account of the responsibilities and functions to be devolved to local
government, ignore the fiscal implications and lack supporting regulations for
implementation. These issues need to be
clarified in order to resolve disputes between central line agencies and
districts, and to provide a stronger foundation for local governments to move forward; 



2. Improving local government capacity for
equitable service delivery.



Outcome 2 aims to address the
weak capacity of most local authorities in Somalia by providing a
comprehensive package of training and technical support covering basic elements
of local administration. It also seeks
to improve coordination between
districts and the
centre in planning
and programming to ensure
better consistency and use
of resources. A third output is concerned with increasing
locally generated revenues and strengthening the role and coverage of the LDF;
and, 



1.
Improving
and expanding the delivery of sustainable services to citizens in an equitable,
responsive and socially accountable manner and promoting local economic
environment.



Outcome 3 focuses on improving
the delivery of local services. This is
to be achieved by collaborating more closely with central line
departments, engaging more
directly with non-state
providers, and enhancing
the accountability of local governments to their constituents. Another
element relates to strengthening the local economy, promoting private
investment and enterprise, and creating more and better job opportunities.

The overall objective of JPGL II is to promote
improvements in local governance quality that can contribute to peace
consolidation, development and equitable service delivery. For JPLG's overall
objective to be realised, a number of agents
will have to
promote change that
can alter the
status quo in
a direction that
fosters a stronger, more
responsive and accountable
compact between the
state and its
citizens in the
provision of service delivery.
Despite progress the
current context is
still characterised by
limited trust in
government structures at both central and local levels, which in turn
means that their legitimacy is often contested.
This can increase the
risk of a
return to instability
and conflict. Moreover, the political space is still limited especially in southern areas, where
radical groups restrict the voice of many, including women. There is thus
a need
to consolidate and
enlarge the space
for non-state actors
in the rest
of Somalia and
to restore a healthy and accountable state citizen
nexus. 



To achieve the overall objective of JPLG II, the
programme outcomes are structured around three mutually reinforcing
strategies: 



1. Supporting policy and legislative reforms for
functional, fiscal and administrative decentralization that clarify and enhance
the role of local government, its relationship to central government, and as a
means to improve local service delivery.



Outcome 1 will focus on policy
and legal frameworks across Somalia
and is initially designed to address weaknesses in current laws on
decentralization in Somaliland and
Puntland. These provide an incomplete
account of the responsibilities and functions to be devolved to local
government, ignore the fiscal implications and lack supporting regulations for
implementation. These issues need to be
clarified in order to resolve disputes between central line agencies and
districts, and to provide a stronger foundation for local governments to move forward; 



2. Improving local government capacity for
equitable service delivery.



Outcome 2 aims to address the
weak capacity of most local authorities in Somalia by providing a
comprehensive package of training and technical support covering basic elements
of local administration. It also seeks
to improve coordination between
districts and the
centre in planning
and programming to ensure
better consistency and use
of resources. A third output is concerned with increasing
locally generated revenues and strengthening the role and coverage of the LDF;
and, 



1.
Improving
and expanding the delivery of sustainable services to citizens in an equitable,
responsive and socially accountable manner and promoting local economic
environment.



Outcome 3 focuses on improving
the delivery of local services. This is
to be achieved by collaborating more closely with central line
departments, engaging more
directly with non-state
providers, and enhancing
the accountability of local governments to their constituents. Another
element relates to strengthening the local economy, promoting private
investment and enterprise, and creating more and better job opportunities. 



In all of these efforts, JPLG II recognizes the
paramount importance of respecting and promoting local ownership, commitment
and leadership. Without these ingredients,
the prospects of sustaining gains are substantially diminished. For this purpose, JPLG II will continue seek
support and political commitment at the highest
levels of Government,

The purpose is to undertake the PILaR global pilot as a learning exercise both for the city of Medellin and Colombia as well as for UN-Habitat in order to learn how to support member states and municipalities to do PILaR. Through this project, the municipality may be able to shift and rapidly address its high rates of informality and deprivation therefore achieving a more sustainable urban development. 
Land readjustment is a technique whereby a group of neighboring landowners in an urban-fringe area are combined in a partnership for the unified planning, servicing and subdivision of their land with the project costs and benefits being shared between the landowners. 
The benefits of land readjustment are vast for urban development. The attraction of land readjustment for landowners is that they can develop their property and get value gains from urbanization. For local governments, it ensures efficient urbanization of land at reduced cost because the project site and infrastructure rights of way do not have to be purchased or compulsorily acquired. The cost of the infrastructure and subdivision can be financed with a short/medium-term loan which, depending on the land contribution ratio of participating landowners, may be repaid through the sale of some of the new building plots. 
However, for land readjustment approach UN-Habitat is proposing to bear fruits, there needs to be a conducive legal framework, professional capability to manage the process and a genuine commitment to stakeholder and community engagement, which is often lacking in developing countries. Other limitations may include that the land may take many years to be developed and occupied, whereas the government's objective is to achieve early development and a flow of revenues. Another limitation is that the ability of land readjustment projects to engage with and provide access to land for lower-income groups is limited by the need to provide the original land owners with an increased value for the smaller plot areas they receive after land subdivision and servicing.
The Participatory and Inclusive Land Readjustment (PILaR) aims at enabling Medellin –and potentially developing countries– to use the land readjustment technique to undertake orderly and proactive city extension and densification in a pro-poor, participatory and gender-responsive manner, empowering the municipalities to facilitate this process. UN-Habitat aims at introducing PILaR as a new service for national governments and local authorities to better tackle urbanization challenges, such as urban sprawl and the slums, through a rights-based approach where participation and inclusivity will be central. 
The project aims therefore at creating a conducive environment for PILaR in Medellin, Colombia: enhancing legislation, if needed, and building the capacity of the municipality in land readjustment and participatory processes. The project will also look at improving the supply of serviced urban land through orderly and negotiated process of PILaR (prior to investment phase). As a result of this project, an investment phase shall follow up creating a compact, well connected and inclusive neighborhood, if funding is available. 
If the project is done, a sound participatory process will have been carried out in the selected site and an overall agreement will be reached for its redevelopment which will create a more compact, well connected, inclusive and sustainable neighborhood. If the project is not done, the situation in Medellin may remain as it is now: a territory with challenges to densify its space in a quick and inclusive manner. Medellin and UN-Habitat would also miss a good opportunity of participatory methodology in redevelopment processes. 
The citizens of Medellin are expected to be the ultimate beneficiaries of this project (in particular those living and those that will end up living in the selected project site), including and with a particular focus on the most vulnerable. Once the project site is selected within the city, a community profile will be done, gathering data, including sex-disaggregated information.
The city of Medellin will directly benefit as it will gain knowledge and experienced on how to undertake PILaR for sustainable urban development together with UN-Habitat. The city can then use this knowledge gained in the selected pilot site to apply it to other sites in the city as soon as possible. Other beneficiaries include the Government of Colombia (Department of National Planning, Ministry of Housing, Cities and Territory), the private sector (including developers) benefiting from the densification of the site (and potentially the city), and community-based organizations that will learn how to engage and participate in a PILaR process and inclusive urban development. 
This project has four levels of intervention. The first level is the city, and the selected site in particular, where most of the learning and negotiations will occur. A second layer will be the national level which will be accompanying this process and learning from it for possible replication. The third level is the regional one, in Latin America, where other cities may be interesting in learning from this experience. Last but not least, the global level will develop the learning of this process, including with awareness materials, technical tools, documented case studies and analysis of good practices on both the criteria needed for succeeding with land readjustment and how it can be effectively undertaken. The city and the global levels are the most time and resource-intensive levels. Learning how to use land readjustment and experimenting PILaR will therefore be central to this innovate project.

Following the July 2006 Israeli war, UN-Habitat Lebanon implemented a project titled “Good governance for enhanced post-war reconstruction in South Lebanon” which aimed at enhancing the capacities of affected families and municipalities to better manage the reconstruction process. Within this project, three Regional Technical Offices (RTOs) were established in three targeted Unions of Municipalities (UoMs); Tyre, Bint Jbeil and Jabal Amel. The RTO's engineers and field officers, being part of the local communities, were able, in a short period of time, to mobilize and immediately provide assistance to affected families as well as to concerned municipalities. By assisting the municipalities with rapid technical assessments of the buildings needing reconstruction work, and providing information and guidelines for house owners with ABCs in repair work, the RTOs contributed to a broad and swift rehabilitation process with the local actors at the steering wheel. 


Based on the previous experience UN-Habitat now replicates the RTO model to support the efforts of providing shelter and services for Syrian refugees as well as meeting the needs of the house communities, by enhancing the role of local authorities. In the first pilot phase two RTOs will be established under the mandate of two Unions of Municipalities within the Saida/Zahrani and Chouf districts. After the pilot RTOs are put in place and anticipated system and mechanisms tested, the approach will be applied in more Unions with further geographical outreach. The aim is to establish a model that could work within all Unions of Municipalities in Lebanon, covering more than 800 of the 1000 Municipalities in the country. To ensure that the project is able to rapidly apply the model in new Unions, a second batch of another three Unions of Municipalities is identified. 
This proposed Project, with a focus on enhancing the involvement of municipalities in responding to the needs of Syrian refugees, would i) complement the efforts of the Government, UNHCR, and other UN, national and international agencies, ii) accelerate the assistance process addressed to refugees, and iii) reduce the tension between host communities and refugees.The goal of the project is to respond to the immediate needs of Syrian refugees and host communities in different areas of Lebanon while laying the foundation for medium and long term sustainable solutions. 

In line with the project goal, the proposed action is planned to achieve two main objectives: 
- Accelerate the accommodation process of refugee families through the active involvement of municipalities and unions of municipalities in identifying, assessing and facilitating sound shelter facilities that comply with UNHCR standards and norms. 
- Support host communities through the implementation of sound projects that would respond to community groups needs and would enhance the delivery of basic urban services taking into account the existing and forthcoming numbers of refugees.


The strategy would include the following:
At the national level, UN-Habitat has been coordinating and will continue collaboration with UNHCR, the Ministry of Social Affairs (MoSA), the Ministry of Interior and Municipalities (MoIM) and other concerned governmental institutions and International agencies. This is being done through taking part in donor meetings as well as working groups, mainly shelter and WASH, and inter-agency meetings.
At the regional levels, in addition to municipalities and unions of municipalities, bureaus and representatives of government and international and UN agencies would constantly be engaged in the project processes, notably the Qaimmaqams (Heads of district/Caza leading the regional security cells), UNHCR and other international agencies regional offices. The project will also collaborate and complement on-going and recent UN initiatives in the targeted areas dealing with issues related to Syrian refugees.


The project will set up a model whereby unions of municipalities, municipalities, and communities are actively and constantly engaged in responding to the needs of the Syrian refugees. Partnerships with key local actors represent a core value for this project. The involvement of local actors will prevent possible bottleneck situations in the response, as it will not be limited to agencies already concerned with overstretched capacities.

national and local governments as well as relevant stakeholder's capacities for
improving urban planning and urban policies leading to sustainable urban
development. For the case of Medellin,
the project aims to support the development of strategic interventions (through
technical assistance, policy advice and project development), that will support
the consolidation of ongoing institutional reforms aiming at improving the
management of the habitat in the city in a more comprehensive manner. 



Due to the fact that Medellin will host the World Urban Forum 7, to
take place in 2014, this particular project is an opportunity to document and
learn from the specific experience of Medellin, in how to address social
challenges with adequate urban management mechanisms. In this sense, the
project aims to broaden the scope of specific urban interventions in order to
reach further and address inequity and poverty challenges that have been
growing as rapid as the urbanization of Medellin has been moving forward.



With this in mind, and considering that ASUD is a global pilot of UN-Habitat,
and therefore it is considered to be part of a global learning platform, the following
outputs and activities will be prioritized: 



To support the institutional reform that the city
requires to adjust itself in order to face growing urban challenges within a
more comprehensive concept of “Habitat”. To achieve this, the project will conduct studies on all institutional structure/capacities with special emphasis on
ISVIMED as the leading institution on social housing. Throughout consultations
and international references, the project will propose a new legal and
institutional framework aligned with the city's habitat requirements. An
awareness campaign regarding institutional adjustments will be conducted in the

The project will support the Land Commission in fulfilling its role as the leading agency on reforms in the land sector and in pursuing more effective land governance in Liberia. It will also support much-needed and important outreach and education on the Land Commission's landmark new Land Rights Policy, finalized in May 2013, which provides clear and important guarantees for, inter alia, rights for communities to customary land, and women's rights to land. New priorities under the proposed project will add an additional and needed new focus on urban land disputes and on concession-related disputes. A combination of activities and research will be undertaken, which will feed into an ultimate policy on alternative dispute resolution, based on Liberian experiences and traditions, human rights principles, and national and international best practices. The policy formulation process will also include attention to differing effects on men and women, rural and urban dwellers, and winners and losers in land disputes.

The main focus of the project is on pilot Land Coordination Centres (LCCs), set up under the last tranche of PBF funding. Research on existing land dispute resolution mechanisms funded by UN-Habitat in 2011 found that multiple community-level mechanisms already existed[1]. Thus, rather than adding a new actor to the mix, the LC decided to set up centres that would provide a umbrella to coordinate all those ad hoc community actors into a system. The LCCs do outreach and education, establish a common documentation system for dispute resolvers, track the work done by all dispute resolvers to avoid forum shopping, keep a repository of documents and data, follow up on resolved disputes to help ensure sustainability, and provide training and technical assistance to community members in their dispute resolution work. The LCCs also collect and document best practices and lessons learned. UN-Habitat and USAID's Land Conflict Resolution Project (LCRP) are jointly supporting the LCCs. LCCs were piloted in 5 counties covering 10 districts determined by LC research to be land dispute “hotspots”.

The project has three major expected accomplishments

EA1. Development of a system of land dispute resolution, through support to Land Coordination Centres, which are supporting community land dispute resolution services, including coordination with work on concessions

EA2.  Improved understanding of urban disputes, and their effects on women, as well as the displaced, for Land Commission/New Agency

EA3.  Policies and transition strategy established for 
alternative dispute resolution services in new Land Agency


Activities 
Activities continued from the previous PBF project are:
(a) Core support and technical assistance to the pilot Land Coordination Centres, which are supporting community dispute resolution services (provided by, inter alia: traditional elders, statutory officials, women's groups such as those supported by UN-Women's conflict project, UNMIL-supported Peace Committees, youth, and others); (b) Promoting awareness of land rights, land laws, and options for peaceful resolution of land disputes, through the activities of the LCCs and at LC central level (in partnership with USAID/LCRP); (c) Developing a national land dispute resolution policy, using results from LCC activities and working with interagency Land Dispute Resolution Taskforces at national and local level (bringing together Government agencies, civil society and other stakeholders) (d) Developing a national alternative dispute resolution system for all disputes, with the Ministry of Justice

New activities will include:
(a) Establishment of a new Land Coordination Centre focusing on urban land disputes; (b) Institutionalisation of conflict-sensitive concession agreements with built-in mechanisms for recognition of community land rights and conflict resolution with communities, via the work of a new conflict and concession Program Officer at the Land Commission; (c) Technical assistance to the LC as it begins a transition to a new land agency, to ensure that new land administration and land use and management responsibilities are linked clearly to the nascent land dispute resolution system; (d) Ensuring joint activities are undertaken by LCCs and the PBF-funded Justice and Security Hubs (through, inter alia, LC training and education of Hub staff on land cases; joint outreach and education initiatives; mutual referral systems); (e) Absorbing already-established trusted and professional surveying capacity into the LCCs to improve land dispute resolution capacity (surveyors will be drawn from the Norwegian Refugee Council's land disputes project, which is shutting down)

New studies (focusing on urban land disputes):
(a) Case studies of 1-3 real-time urban land disputes with significant conflict potential, focusing on analysis of ripeness and possible solutions (if cases are ongoing) or sustainability of solutions (if cases have been resolved). Possible solutions will be examined with a special effort to identify mechanisms to help secure agreements through public investments in infrastructure and services. The studies will also include an analysis of institutional framework and gaps. The studies willproduce recommendations on policy solutions (including regarding forced evictions/resettlement), methodologies specifically tailored for urban land dispute resolution, and any institutional changes needed
(b) Identifying the land and property challenges faced by urban women in Liberia, proposing options for addressing them. This study will particularly draw upon the work of the Land and Gender Desk supported by UNWomen in the Ministry of Gender and Development

- Key target groups/beneficiaries:
An alternative land dispute resolution system will primarily benefit the poor and the most vulnerable, including women, who may be financially unable to afford court fees or who may believe court decisions are for sale to the highest bidder. Indigenous people, who have traditional tribal ownership certificates which fall short of full statutory title, will also benefit from an alternative system. An increase in the capacity of communities to settle disputes peacefully will have overall benefits for everyone, increasing social cohesion and reconciliation and reducing flashpoints for conflict. And in addition, any bona fide statutory landowner facing counterclaims or disputes who can regularize their tenure will also benefit, and will be able to use their land with more certainty. This should lead to major economic benefits and stability for the country. The possibility of decreasing the burden on the court system will also have quantifiable benefits. One study in 2008 showed that approximately 1500 land cases were pending in two counties alone, and that land cases in courts can take 8-12 years to resolve. An alternate resolution system will be cheaper, easier to access, and should take much less time.

Studies on urban land disputes and recommendations on solutions for those who may be the “losers” in land regularisation (e.g. squatter communities or communities in concession areas) will also benefit those who may lack strict legal rights but for whom social policy solutions are needed (to avoid the risks associated with creating large groups of angry, dispossessed people with nothing left to lose). Studies targeting women and land disputes in urban areas will help develop land dispute resolution policy and solutions to ensure that women get equal benefit from the dispute resolution system.

Technical assistance to the LC at a time of transition will benefit the staff already serving and will help the new agency take on a wider range of tasks without losing the key achievements already gained in the area of land dispute resolution, thus benefiting the country broadly.

 
 rovide other supportment of natural resourcesand consequence of Liberi'onflict resolution in Liberia.The project activities aim to build upon existing and traditional systems of conflict resolution in Liberia, while giving disputants other options as well (e.g. women who do not wish to go to a traditional male council of elders will have other avenues); to strengthen or create systems of resolution in urban areas, where traditional solutions may no longer exist or may not always be appropriate; to institutionalize recognition of community land rights and conflict sensitivity in Liberia's concession agreements; and to use the findings of the activities and studies in order to recommend solutions for those who may be on the losing end of dispute resolution. The specific findings collected from the PBF-funded land dispute resolution activities and studies undertaken in 2013 and 2014 will be used to develop overarching policy solutions and administrativeready gained in the area of land dispute resolution, thus benefiting the country broadly.the new agency take and transition strategies before the end of the life of the LC at end-2014.

The project will support the Land Commission in fulfilling its role as the leading agency on reforms in the land sector and in pursuing more effective land governance in Liberia. It will also support much-needed and important outreach and education on the Land Commission's landmark new Land Rights Policy, finalized in May 2013, which provides clear and important guarantees for, inter alia, rights for communities to customary land, and women's rights to land. New priorities under the proposed project will add an additional and needed new focus on urban land disputes and on concession-related disputes. A combination of activities and research will be undertaken, which will feed into an ultimate policy on alternative dispute resolution, based on Liberian experiences and traditions, human rights principles, and national and international best practices. The policy formulation process will also include attention to differing effects on men and women, rural and urban dwellers, and winners and losers in land disputes.

The main focus of the project is on pilot Land Coordination Centres (LCCs), set up under the last tranche of PBF funding. Research on existing land dispute resolution mechanisms funded by UN-Habitat in 2011 found that multiple community-level mechanisms already existed[1]. Thus, rather than adding a new actor to the mix, the LC decided to set up centres that would provide a umbrella to coordinate all those ad hoc community actors into a system. The LCCs do outreach and education, establish a common documentation system for dispute resolvers, track the work done by all dispute resolvers to avoid forum shopping, keep a repository of documents and data, follow up on resolved disputes to help ensure sustainability, and provide training and technical assistance to community members in their dispute resolution work. The LCCs also collect and document best practices and lessons learned. UN-Habitat and USAID's Land Conflict Resolution Project (LCRP) are jointly supporting the LCCs. LCCs were piloted in 5 counties covering 10 districts determined by LC research to be land dispute “hotspots”.

The project has three major expected accomplishments

EA1. Development of a system of land dispute resolution, through support to Land Coordination Centres, which are supporting community land dispute resolution services, including coordination with work on concessions

EA2.  Improved understanding of urban disputes, and their effects on women, as well as the displaced, for Land Commission/New Agency

EA3.  Policies and transition strategy established for 
alternative dispute resolution services in new Land Agency


Activities 
Activities continued from the previous PBF project are:
(a) Core support and technical assistance to the pilot Land Coordination Centres, which are supporting community dispute resolution services (provided by, inter alia: traditional elders, statutory officials, women's groups such as those supported by UN-Women's conflict project, UNMIL-supported Peace Committees, youth, and others); (b) Promoting awareness of land rights, land laws, and options for peaceful resolution of land disputes, through the activities of the LCCs and at LC central level (in partnership with USAID/LCRP); (c) Developing a national land dispute resolution policy, using results from LCC activities and working with interagency Land Dispute Resolution Taskforces at national and local level (bringing together Government agencies, civil society and other stakeholders) (d) Developing a national alternative dispute resolution system for all disputes, with the Ministry of Justice

New activities will include:
(a) Establishment of a new Land Coordination Centre focusing on urban land disputes; (b) Institutionalisation of conflict-sensitive concession agreements with built-in mechanisms for recognition of community land rights and conflict resolution with communities, via the work of a new conflict and concession Program Officer at the Land Commission; (c) Technical assistance to the LC as it begins a transition to a new land agency, to ensure that new land administration and land use and management responsibilities are linked clearly to the nascent land dispute resolution system; (d) Ensuring joint activities are undertaken by LCCs and the PBF-funded Justice and Security Hubs (through, inter alia, LC training and education of Hub staff on land cases; joint outreach and education initiatives; mutual referral systems); (e) Absorbing already-established trusted and professional surveying capacity into the LCCs to improve land dispute resolution capacity (surveyors will be drawn from the Norwegian Refugee Council's land disputes project, which is shutting down)

New studies (focusing on urban land disputes):
(a) Case studies of 1-3 real-time urban land disputes with significant conflict potential, focusing on analysis of ripeness and possible solutions (if cases are ongoing) or sustainability of solutions (if cases have been resolved). Possible solutions will be examined with a special effort to identify mechanisms to help secure agreements through public investments in infrastructure and services. The studies will also include an analysis of institutional framework and gaps. The studies willproduce recommendations on policy solutions (including regarding forced evictions/resettlement), methodologies specifically tailored for urban land dispute resolution, and any institutional changes needed
(b) Identifying the land and property challenges faced by urban women in Liberia, proposing options for addressing them. This study will particularly draw upon the work of the Land and Gender Desk supported by UNWomen in the Ministry of Gender and Development

- Key target groups/beneficiaries:
An alternative land dispute resolution system will primarily benefit the poor and the most vulnerable, including women, who may be financially unable to afford court fees or who may believe court decisions are for sale to the highest bidder. Indigenous people, who have traditional tribal ownership certificates which fall short of full statutory title, will also benefit from an alternative system. An increase in the capacity of communities to settle disputes peacefully will have overall benefits for everyone, increasing social cohesion and reconciliation and reducing flashpoints for conflict. And in addition, any bona fide statutory landowner facing counterclaims or disputes who can regularize their tenure will also benefit, and will be able to use their land with more certainty. This should lead to major economic benefits and stability for the country. The possibility of decreasing the burden on the court system will also have quantifiable benefits. One study in 2008 showed that approximately 1500 land cases were pending in two counties alone, and that land cases in courts can take 8-12 years to resolve. An alternate resolution system will be cheaper, easier to access, and should take much less time.

Studies on urban land disputes and recommendations on solutions for those who may be the “losers” in land regularisation (e.g. squatter communities or communities in concession areas) will also benefit those who may lack strict legal rights but for whom social policy solutions are needed (to avoid the risks associated with creating large groups of angry, dispossessed people with nothing left to lose). Studies targeting women and land disputes in urban areas will help develop land dispute resolution policy and solutions to ensure that women get equal benefit from the dispute resolution system.

Technical assistance to the LC at a time of transition will benefit the staff already serving and will help the new agency take on a wider range of tasks without losing the key achievements already gained in the area of land dispute resolution, thus benefiting the country broadly.

 
 rovide other supportment of natural resourcesand consequence of Liberi'onflict resolution in Liberia.The project activities aim to build upon existing and traditional systems of conflict resolution in Liberia, while giving disputants other options as well (e.g. women who do not wish to go to a traditional male council of elders will have other avenues); to strengthen or create systems of resolution in urban areas, where traditional solutions may no longer exist or may not always be appropriate; to institutionalize recognition of community land rights and conflict sensitivity in Liberia's concession agreements; and to use the findings of the activities and studies in order to recommend solutions for those who may be on the losing end of dispute resolution. The specific findings collected from the PBF-funded land dispute resolution activities and studies undertaken in 2013 and 2014 will be used to develop overarching policy solutions and administrativeready gained in the area of land dispute resolution, thus benefiting the country broadly.the new agency take and transition strategies before the end of the life of the LC at end-2014.

The programme will encourage participatory planning, create more opportunities for partnerships, and equip governments of small, medium and larger cities to understand and identify problems, and design and implement urban planning options for the future of their cities. A key philosophy of the programme is that it will look at the city as a whole rather than from the more common sectorial approach. It will also look at cities in their regional contexts.

As illustrated in Figure 1 below, two streams of activities in the first and second years will lead to informed policy analysis and a set of 17 action plans (one per participating city), namely (i) identification of indicators and city-level data collection on multiple dimensions of prosperity, using UN-Habitat's City Prosperity Index and (ii) reviews of existing Saudi planning practices and consideration of principles and approaches to a new urban agenda. The participatory processes built into the programme will result in inclusive, evidence-based policy analysis and customised action plans, in direct support of Saudi Arabia's Country Programme Outcome 1.2.  The data generated will feed into 17 national reports an all-encompassing State of Saudi Cities Report and a State of Saudi Youth Report. These sets of information will also support the Saudi national reporting to Habitat III.
Through using UN-Habitat's City Prosperity Index, city authorities and local stakeholders will be able to identify opportunities and potential areas of intervention for their cities to become more prosperous.  It includes various indices and indicators that are relevant to cities and important for prosperity-oriented public policy-making. The Index focuses on individual cities and measures prosperity across seven dimensions –productivity, infrastructure, quality of life, equity, environmental sustainability, urban form and structure; and institutions, laws and governance (see Table 1).The Index is based on the recognition that prosperity requires the urban functions to be subsumed in all the main categories above. UN-Habitat's Wheel of Urban Prosperity, which will be used as a tool in the programme, illustrates the balanced development of the five dimensions “spokes” of prosperity (productivity, infrastructure development, quality of life, equity and social inclusion, and environmental sustainability) and the two elements of urban form and structure and institutions, laws and governance (in the centre of the wheel). 
Table 1:Seven dimensions of prosperity
Productivity	Contributes to economic growth and development, generates income, provides decent jobs and equal opportunities for all through effective economic policies and reforms.
Infrastructure development	Provides adequate infrastructure- water, sanitation, roads, information and communication technology- in order to improve living standards and enhance productivity, mobility and connectivity.
Quality of life	Enhances the use of public space for the sake of community cohesion and civic identity, and guarantees individual and material safety and security.
Equity and social inclusion	Ensures equitable (re)distribution of the benefits of prosperity, reduces poverty and the incidence of slums, protects the rights of minority and vulnerable groups, enhances gender and youth equality, and ensures civic participation in the social, political and cultural spheres.
Environmental sustainability	Values the protection of the urban environment and natural assets while ensuring growth, pursues energy efficiency, reduces pressure on surrounding land and natural resources, reduces environmental losses through creative, environment-enhancing solutions.
Urban form and structure 	Recognized the element of urban planning that determines the urban form, including  street planning and how it influences the other dimensions of prosperity, including street networks and mobility patterns.
Institutions, laws and governance	Government institutions, laws and governance will drive the decisions that Saudi cities are able, and choose to take

Through using the City Prosperity Index, city authorities and local stakeholders will be able to identify opportunities and potential areas of intervention for their cities to become more prosperous. The Index is based on the recognition that prosperity requires the urban functions to be subsumed in all the main categories. Since shared and balanced development is a crucial feature of prosperity, none of the dimensions must prevail over the others and all must be kept roughly ‘equal' on the path of prosperity. UN-Habitat will be including youth and gender-specific indicators within the Index across the 17 cities, with the goal of determining a baseline on the needs of these population groups. 

Government institutions, laws and urban planning, innovation and creativity will drive the decisions that Saudi cities are able, and choose to take.As part of the evidence for the policy process, a baseline of the legislative and institutional context will be undertaken. This will be used as a framework for analytical study into the principal policy objectives to be addressed, including the collective functioning of the various levels of Saudi government and administration in delivering outcomes at the local level. Initial discussions suggest that priorities may include: a review of the Urban Planning Act; analysis of implementation bottlenecks of existing spatial strategy and plans; responses to informal settlements; and, options for preventing urban sprawl and urban expansion. Once the action plans have been agreed upon, recommendations for any key areas of legislative/institutional change will be provided proposed and validated through both desk based and participatory means.  An implementation plan for undertaking any legislative and institutional changes will also be prepared as part of the programme.

The programme will then in its third and fourth year support the implementation of three innovative, but representative, demonstration projects prioritized through the action planning process. These will be implemented with co-financing from the municipalities of the three cities selected and be carefully documented for wider learning.

The programme will capitalize on relevant projects, studies and surveys that have been conducted through the existing and revised National Spatial Strategy and in support of the National and Local Urban Observatories in Saudi Arabia. It will significantly build on them and undertake to develop capacity for implementation of plans. By doing this, the process will ensure that urban planning, legal, regulatory and institutional frameworks become an instrument of city prosperity and well-being. 

A new urban and regional planning vision will require a number of changes in the structure and growth of Saudi cities, moving away from urban sprawl and low densities to more compact cities,  replace segregation, including that of informal settlements with more integrated cities, and replace congested cities with those that are better connected. The programme will promote a number of options for urban patterns of green growth through city-region planning and creating sustainable urban space through planned city-extensions. It will also promote and build capacity around the importance of public space (with proper layouts) and options for street development. An important component of the localization of the City Prosperity Index in Saudi Arabia will be to integrate streets into the analysis, and to recognize that urban form, planning and structure play an important part in a city's prosperity.  

Capacity development is critical to the programme's overall purpose and success, and will be addressed from the start (through a capacity needs/gap assessment and orientation workshops), and throughout the four years (with customized training, international experts and exchange visits), to enhance the set of skills required for the new urban vision, and to ensure sustainability. The programme will develop and strengthen national and local institutional and human resources capacities to understand, anticipate, plan, and manage urban growth.  The Saudi Training Centre on Sustainable Urbanization, expected to be established during the programme phase through a separate source of funding, will provide an important mechanism to sustain and continually enhance this knowledge and skills.

To create a sound participatory process, an important component will be to enable and build capacities for fuller engagement by young women and men, and the overall female population, in Saudi urbanization processes and outcomes. The programme will establish mechanisms for such participatory process through mapping and analysis of youth concerns in cities, the integration of youth and gender indicators into the City Prosperity Index, and workshops for young people and women to constructively engage on urban issues and enhance their capacity in urban development issues that can feed into sustainable structures for further engagement. These activities will help identify champions and organizations to launch a Saudi Youth Sustainable Urbanization Network and Saudi Women Sustainable Urbanization Network, and to support them to engage throughout the implementation of the programme.

The population of the 17 participating cities is the ultimate beneficiaries of this programme. The programme will redefine the role of residents in the process of city development to be more active in defining the city they want. The capacity development component that will improve city planning and management will result in improved services to the local populaton. It is expected that laws and regulations reforms will help also to simplify procedures for local population access to city services. 

Local authorities and involved Ministries will themselves directly benefit through enhancing knowledge and experience on new approaches to manage their cities in a more sustainable way. Decision-makers through updated policies and strategies and city reports will be able to make more informed decisions

The programme will be undertaken over a four year period and consists of two main phases, though some of the activities will be implemented and outputs produced through the two phases:

Phase I:  Diagnosis, analysis and consultation (24 months): 
?	Initial baselines and reviews of the institutional and legislative context of Saudi Arabia, urban planning practices, sectoral linkages, women and youth analysis and capacity development needs; 
?	Integration of the City Prosperity Index and diagnosis and identification of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and challenges in Saudi cities, along with future visualization of Saudi cities;
?	Consultative processes focused on the identification and validation of important policy objectives, the development of hypotheses and recommendations for action, inclusion of youth and women's participation including through establishment of two Networks, and a Saudi National Urban Forum;
?	Training needs and gap assessment and development of a capacity development strategy;
?	Preparation of the Saudi Urban Future report and a Youth and Saudi Cities Report for the analysis of different challenges facing prosperity and sustainability of Saudi cities; and

The programme will encourage participatory planning, create more opportunities for partnerships, and equip governments of small, medium and larger cities to understand and identify problems, and design and implement urban planning options for the future of their cities. A key philosophy of the programme is that it will look at the city as a whole rather than from the more common sectorial approach. It will also look at cities in their regional contexts.

As illustrated in Figure 1 below, two streams of activities in the first and second years will lead to informed policy analysis and a set of 17 action plans (one per participating city), namely (i) identification of indicators and city-level data collection on multiple dimensions of prosperity, using UN-Habitat's City Prosperity Index and (ii) reviews of existing Saudi planning practices and consideration of principles and approaches to a new urban agenda. The participatory processes built into the programme will result in inclusive, evidence-based policy analysis and customised action plans, in direct support of Saudi Arabia's Country Programme Outcome 1.2.  The data generated will feed into 17 national reports an all-encompassing State of Saudi Cities Report and a State of Saudi Youth Report. These sets of information will also support the Saudi national reporting to Habitat III.
Through using UN-Habitat's City Prosperity Index, city authorities and local stakeholders will be able to identify opportunities and potential areas of intervention for their cities to become more prosperous.  It includes various indices and indicators that are relevant to cities and important for prosperity-oriented public policy-making. The Index focuses on individual cities and measures prosperity across seven dimensions –productivity, infrastructure, quality of life, equity, environmental sustainability, urban form and structure; and institutions, laws and governance (see Table 1).The Index is based on the recognition that prosperity requires the urban functions to be subsumed in all the main categories above. UN-Habitat's Wheel of Urban Prosperity, which will be used as a tool in the programme, illustrates the balanced development of the five dimensions “spokes” of prosperity (productivity, infrastructure development, quality of life, equity and social inclusion, and environmental sustainability) and the two elements of urban form and structure and institutions, laws and governance (in the centre of the wheel). 
Table 1:Seven dimensions of prosperity
Productivity	Contributes to economic growth and development, generates income, provides decent jobs and equal opportunities for all through effective economic policies and reforms.
Infrastructure development	Provides adequate infrastructure- water, sanitation, roads, information and communication technology- in order to improve living standards and enhance productivity, mobility and connectivity.
Quality of life	Enhances the use of public space for the sake of community cohesion and civic identity, and guarantees individual and material safety and security.
Equity and social inclusion	Ensures equitable (re)distribution of the benefits of prosperity, reduces poverty and the incidence of slums, protects the rights of minority and vulnerable groups, enhances gender and youth equality, and ensures civic participation in the social, political and cultural spheres.
Environmental sustainability	Values the protection of the urban environment and natural assets while ensuring growth, pursues energy efficiency, reduces pressure on surrounding land and natural resources, reduces environmental losses through creative, environment-enhancing solutions.
Urban form and structure 	Recognized the element of urban planning that determines the urban form, including  street planning and how it influences the other dimensions of prosperity, including street networks and mobility patterns.
Institutions, laws and governance	Government institutions, laws and governance will drive the decisions that Saudi cities are able, and choose to take

Through using the City Prosperity Index, city authorities and local stakeholders will be able to identify opportunities and potential areas of intervention for their cities to become more prosperous. The Index is based on the recognition that prosperity requires the urban functions to be subsumed in all the main categories. Since shared and balanced development is a crucial feature of prosperity, none of the dimensions must prevail over the others and all must be kept roughly ‘equal' on the path of prosperity. UN-Habitat will be including youth and gender-specific indicators within the Index across the 17 cities, with the goal of determining a baseline on the needs of these population groups. 

Government institutions, laws and urban planning, innovation and creativity will drive the decisions that Saudi cities are able, and choose to take.As part of the evidence for the policy process, a baseline of the legislative and institutional context will be undertaken. This will be used as a framework for analytical study into the principal policy objectives to be addressed, including the collective functioning of the various levels of Saudi government and administration in delivering outcomes at the local level. Initial discussions suggest that priorities may include: a review of the Urban Planning Act; analysis of implementation bottlenecks of existing spatial strategy and plans; responses to informal settlements; and, options for preventing urban sprawl and urban expansion. Once the action plans have been agreed upon, recommendations for any key areas of legislative/institutional change will be provided proposed and validated through both desk based and participatory means.  An implementation plan for undertaking any legislative and institutional changes will also be prepared as part of the programme.

The programme will then in its third and fourth year support the implementation of three innovative, but representative, demonstration projects prioritized through the action planning process. These will be implemented with co-financing from the municipalities of the three cities selected and be carefully documented for wider learning.

The programme will capitalize on relevant projects, studies and surveys that have been conducted through the existing and revised National Spatial Strategy and in support of the National and Local Urban Observatories in Saudi Arabia. It will significantly build on them and undertake to develop capacity for implementation of plans. By doing this, the process will ensure that urban planning, legal, regulatory and institutional frameworks become an instrument of city prosperity and well-being. 

A new urban and regional planning vision will require a number of changes in the structure and growth of Saudi cities, moving away from urban sprawl and low densities to more compact cities,  replace segregation, including that of informal settlements with more integrated cities, and replace congested cities with those that are better connected. The programme will promote a number of options for urban patterns of green growth through city-region planning and creating sustainable urban space through planned city-extensions. It will also promote and build capacity around the importance of public space (with proper layouts) and options for street development. An important component of the localization of the City Prosperity Index in Saudi Arabia will be to integrate streets into the analysis, and to recognize that urban form, planning and structure play an important part in a city's prosperity.  

Capacity development is critical to the programme's overall purpose and success, and will be addressed from the start (through a capacity needs/gap assessment and orientation workshops), and throughout the four years (with customized training, international experts and exchange visits), to enhance the set of skills required for the new urban vision, and to ensure sustainability. The programme will develop and strengthen national and local institutional and human resources capacities to understand, anticipate, plan, and manage urban growth.  The Saudi Training Centre on Sustainable Urbanization, expected to be established during the programme phase through a separate source of funding, will provide an important mechanism to sustain and continually enhance this knowledge and skills.

To create a sound participatory process, an important component will be to enable and build capacities for fuller engagement by young women and men, and the overall female population, in Saudi urbanization processes and outcomes. The programme will establish mechanisms for such participatory process through mapping and analysis of youth concerns in cities, the integration of youth and gender indicators into the City Prosperity Index, and workshops for young people and women to constructively engage on urban issues and enhance their capacity in urban development issues that can feed into sustainable structures for further engagement. These activities will help identify champions and organizations to launch a Saudi Youth Sustainable Urbanization Network and Saudi Women Sustainable Urbanization Network, and to support them to engage throughout the implementation of the programme.

The population of the 17 participating cities is the ultimate beneficiaries of this programme. The programme will redefine the role of residents in the process of city development to be more active in defining the city they want. The capacity development component that will improve city planning and management will result in improved services to the local populaton. It is expected that laws and regulations reforms will help also to simplify procedures for local population access to city services. 

Local authorities and involved Ministries will themselves directly benefit through enhancing knowledge and experience on new approaches to manage their cities in a more sustainable way. Decision-makers through updated policies and strategies and city reports will be able to make more informed decisions

The programme will be undertaken over a four year period and consists of two main phases, though some of the activities will be implemented and outputs produced through the two phases:

Phase I:  Diagnosis, analysis and consultation (24 months): 
?	Initial baselines and reviews of the institutional and legislative context of Saudi Arabia, urban planning practices, sectoral linkages, women and youth analysis and capacity development needs; 
?	Integration of the City Prosperity Index and diagnosis and identification of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and challenges in Saudi cities, along with future visualization of Saudi cities;
?	Consultative processes focused on the identification and validation of important policy objectives, the development of hypotheses and recommendations for action, inclusion of youth and women's participation including through establishment of two Networks, and a Saudi National Urban Forum;
?	Training needs and gap assessment and development of a capacity development strategy;
?	Preparation of the Saudi Urban Future report and a Youth and Saudi Cities Report for the analysis of different challenges facing prosperity and sustainability of Saudi cities; and

Following the July 2006 Israeli war, UN-Habitat Lebanon implemented a project titled “Good governance for enhanced post-war reconstruction in South Lebanon” which aimed at enhancing the capacities of affected families and municipalities to better manage the reconstruction process. Within this project, three Regional Technical Offices (RTOs) were established in three targeted Unions of Municipalities (UoMs); Tyre, Bint Jbeil and Jabal Amel. The RTO's engineers and field officers, being part of the local communities, were able, in a short period of time, to mobilize and immediately provide assistance to affected families as well as to concerned municipalities. By assisting the municipalities with rapid technical assessments of the buildings needing reconstruction work, and providing information and guidelines for house owners with ABCs in repair work, the RTOs contributed to a broad and swift rehabilitation process with the local actors at the steering wheel. 


Based on the previous experience UN-Habitat now replicates the RTO model to support the efforts of providing shelter and services for Syrian refugees as well as meeting the needs of the house communities, by enhancing the role of local authorities. In the first pilot phase two RTOs will be established under the mandate of two Unions of Municipalities within the Saida/Zahrani and Chouf districts. After the pilot RTOs are put in place and anticipated system and mechanisms tested, the approach will be applied in more Unions with further geographical outreach. The aim is to establish a model that could work within all Unions of Municipalities in Lebanon, covering more than 800 of the 1000 Municipalities in the country. To ensure that the project is able to rapidly apply the model in new Unions, a second batch of another three Unions of Municipalities is identified. 
This proposed Project, with a focus on enhancing the involvement of municipalities in responding to the needs of Syrian refugees, would i) complement the efforts of the Government, UNHCR, and other UN, national and international agencies, ii) accelerate the assistance process addressed to refugees, and iii) reduce the tension between host communities and refugees.The goal of the project is to respond to the immediate needs of Syrian refugees and host communities in different areas of Lebanon while laying the foundation for medium and long term sustainable solutions. 

In line with the project goal, the proposed action is planned to achieve two main objectives: 
- Accelerate the accommodation process of refugee families through the active involvement of municipalities and unions of municipalities in identifying, assessing and facilitating sound shelter facilities that comply with UNHCR standards and norms. 
- Support host communities through the implementation of sound projects that would respond to community groups needs and would enhance the delivery of basic urban services taking into account the existing and forthcoming numbers of refugees.


The strategy would include the following:
At the national level, UN-Habitat has been coordinating and will continue collaboration with UNHCR, the Ministry of Social Affairs (MoSA), the Ministry of Interior and Municipalities (MoIM) and other concerned governmental institutions and International agencies. This is being done through taking part in donor meetings as well as working groups, mainly shelter and WASH, and inter-agency meetings.
At the regional levels, in addition to municipalities and unions of municipalities, bureaus and representatives of government and international and UN agencies would constantly be engaged in the project processes, notably the Qaimmaqams (Heads of district/Caza leading the regional security cells), UNHCR and other international agencies regional offices. The project will also collaborate and complement on-going and recent UN initiatives in the targeted areas dealing with issues related to Syrian refugees.


The project will set up a model whereby unions of municipalities, municipalities, and communities are actively and constantly engaged in responding to the needs of the Syrian refugees. Partnerships with key local actors represent a core value for this project. The involvement of local actors will prevent possible bottleneck situations in the response, as it will not be limited to agencies already concerned with overstretched capacities.

goal of the partnership between ESCAP and UN-Habitat is to establish and
operate the first IRRC project in Pakistan, which will be located in
Islamabad's Sector G-15. This IRRC will have the capacity to process 4 ton of
municipal solid waste per day, and it will treat the waste generated in the

social cohesion and possibilities for reconciliation. At the same time, handling
land disputes and promoting an effective land governance system enable economic
recovery and help to tackle poverty, which removes one of the causes of ongoing
conflict. 

The linkages between land disputes, peace, stability and economic
recovery require innovative approaches to deal with land issues in a holistic
manner. Tackling land issues will contribute to reconciliation, facilitate
return and reintegration for IDPs and refugees, reduce the risks of armed
conflict, and enable a stable environment for livelihood improvement through secure
land tenure and access to means of production. The recognition of the
significance of land issues is gaining momentum in the agendas of both
stabilization and development actors, and approaches based on lessons derived
from previous interventions need to be adapted to the context. 



3.1.
Land disputes as a symptom of underlying causes and
not as an end in themselves:



Many interventions in the land sector are focusing on dealing with land
disputes through mediation. Mediating land disputes is a necessary step but it
is not sufficient. There is a need to tackle the root causes of land disputes,
knowing that conflict derives from various factors (legal, ethnic, political,
institutions). 



An innovative
approach may need to perceive land issues through the lens of governance. The
lack of state authority and the failure of the governance system as a whole have
repercussions on land management and allocation. The former stabilization
framework in Eastern DR Congo (ISSSS) only focused on superficial aspects while
mitigating disputes and conflict over land. The approach did not, however, seriously
consider land conflicts as a matter of governance.

3.2.
Long-term approach to comprehensively deal with
land issuesA humanitarian approach to dealing with land issues in post conflict
settings prevailed in the case of DR Congo. Actors were mainly targeting quick
solutions through ad hoc
interventions without developing a long-term vision for the land sector. An
effective long-term vision requires the development of a realistic agenda that takes
a comprehensive approach and links land issues with other critical sectors for peace and stability,
such as security, decentralization and the restoration of state authority.



The long-term solution in DR Congo on land issues is to reconcile
legitimacy and legality regarding land management and governance. The ongoing
land reform process led by the national government becomes an avenue to capture
changes in the land governance system and to reach durable solutions to the
land conflicts. According to the strategic plan developed in 2013, the GoDRC is
expected to come up with a new land policy from which should derive a new land
legal framework adapted to the new context of the DRC, and this by end of 2016.
But due to some delay on the land program implementation this timeline needs to
be reviewed to be realistic. But in the meantime, some keys can be addressed as
long as the government is committed (regulation of land customary rights,
recognition of alternative disputes resolution mechanisms as part of the
institutional framework.







3.3.
Scaling up experiences from local to national:

Until now, most interventions dealing with land issues focus on the
community level with weak linkages to provincial and national levels. Working with local communities should not
exclude certain levels of cooperation with both the provincial and national
levels. Evidence has shown that powerful
actors with influence at the local level of the political crisis in DR Congo
are not necessarily themselves present on the ground. Some are based in capitals
of provinces while others are in Kinshasa occupying political functions; using
proxy means to manage their interests at the local level. 3.4.
Weakness of interventions in the land sector:



Most of the interventions in the land sector are carried out by local
NGOs, mainly focusing on land dispute resolution. The number of NGOs is very
limited taking into account the number of land disputes emerging at the
community level. Some community members do not have access to formal or well
organized dispute resolution mechanisms in the areas covered by UN-Habitat
program (For example, Irumu and Mombassa Territories in Ituri,, Haut Plateaux
in South Kivu). Disequilibrium in the geographical coverage may lead to
disharmony in the treatment of land issues, leading only to partial solutions
to the problem. 



At the same time, many NGOs lack the technical capacity to deal with
land issues. Based of the inherent sensitivity of land issues, actors working
at the community level require a minimum expertise to avoid doing harm when
dealing with land disputes. Land interventions will always have the potential
to aggravate conflicts. Building
capacity for both community members and local organizations is a perquisite for
a successful resolution of land disputes.



Despites progress made with regards to the perception of importance of
land for peace and stability in the DR Congo through the various frameworks,
interventions are still limited in terms of investment. In 2010, the UN Peace Building Funds
allocated 900 000 USD to only one land program amidst large demand on land
disputes resolution at the community level. The funding covered only two
territories in North Kivu (Masisi and Rutshuru). There is a dare need to scale
up interventions and to sustain investments on the sector to better address the
issue.

Following the July 2006 Israeli war, UN-Habitat Lebanon implemented a project titled “Good governance for enhanced post-war reconstruction in South Lebanon” which aimed at enhancing the capacities of affected families and municipalities to better manage the reconstruction process. Within this project, three Regional Technical Offices (RTOs) were established in three targeted Unions of Municipalities (UoMs); Tyre, Bint Jbeil and Jabal Amel. The RTO's engineers and field officers, being part of the local communities, were able, in a short period of time, to mobilize and immediately provide assistance to affected families as well as to concerned municipalities. By assisting the municipalities with rapid technical assessments of the buildings needing reconstruction work, and providing information and guidelines for house owners with ABCs in repair work, the RTOs contributed to a broad and swift rehabilitation process with the local actors at the steering wheel. 


Based on the previous experience UN-Habitat now replicates the RTO model to support the efforts of providing shelter and services for Syrian refugees as well as meeting the needs of the house communities, by enhancing the role of local authorities. In the first pilot phase two RTOs will be established under the mandate of two Unions of Municipalities within the Saida/Zahrani and Chouf districts. After the pilot RTOs are put in place and anticipated system and mechanisms tested, the approach will be applied in more Unions with further geographical outreach. The aim is to establish a model that could work within all Unions of Municipalities in Lebanon, covering more than 800 of the 1000 Municipalities in the country. To ensure that the project is able to rapidly apply the model in new Unions, a second batch of another three Unions of Municipalities is identified. 
This proposed Project, with a focus on enhancing the involvement of municipalities in responding to the needs of Syrian refugees, would i) complement the efforts of the Government, UNHCR, and other UN, national and international agencies, ii) accelerate the assistance process addressed to refugees, and iii) reduce the tension between host communities and refugees.The goal of the project is to respond to the immediate needs of Syrian refugees and host communities in different areas of Lebanon while laying the foundation for medium and long term sustainable solutions. 

In line with the project goal, the proposed action is planned to achieve two main objectives: 
- Accelerate the accommodation process of refugee families through the active involvement of municipalities and unions of municipalities in identifying, assessing and facilitating sound shelter facilities that comply with UNHCR standards and norms. 

- Support host communities through the implementation of sound projects that would respond to community groups needs and would enhance the delivery of basic urban services taking into account the existing and forthcoming numbers of refugees.


The strategy would include the following:
At the national level, UN-Habitat has been coordinating and will continue collaboration with UNHCR, the Ministry of Social Affairs (MoSA), the Ministry of Interior and Municipalities (MoIM) and other concerned governmental institutions and International agencies. This is being done through taking part in donor meetings as well as working groups, mainly shelter and WASH, and inter-agency meetings.
At the regional levels, in addition to municipalities and unions of municipalities, bureaus and representatives of government and international and UN agencies would constantly be engaged in the project processes, notably the Qaimmaqams (Heads of district/Caza leading the regional security cells), UNHCR and other international agencies regional offices. The project will also collaborate and complement on-going and recent UN initiatives in the targeted areas dealing with issues related to Syrian refugees.


The project will set up a model whereby unions of municipalities, municipalities, and communities are actively and constantly engaged in responding to the needs of the Syrian refugees. Partnerships with key local actors represent a core value for this project. The involvement of local actors will prevent possible bottleneck situations in the response, as it will not be limited to agencies already concerned with overstretched capacities.

This proposed Project, with a focus on enhancing the involvement of municipalities in responding to the needs of Syrian refugees, would i) complement the efforts of the Government, UNHCR, and other UN, national and international agencies, ii) accelerate the assistance process addressed to refugees, and iii) reduce the tension between host communities and refugees.The goal of the project is to respond to the immediate needs of Syrian refugees and host communities in different areas of Lebanon while laying the foundation for medium and long term sustainable solutions. 

In line with the project goal, the proposed action is planned to achieve two main objectives: 
- Accelerate the accommodation process of refugee families through the active involvement of municipalities and unions of municipalities in identifying, assessing and facilitating sound shelter facilities that comply with UNHCR standards and norms. 

- Support host communities through the implementation of sound projects that would respond to community groups needs and would enhance the delivery of basic urban services taking into account the existing and forthcoming numbers of refugees.


The strategy would include the following:
At the national level, UN-Habitat has been coordinating and will continue collaboration with UNHCR, the Ministry of Social Affairs (MoSA), the Ministry of Interior and Municipalities (MoIM) and other concerned governmental institutions and International agencies. This is being done through taking part in donor meetings as well as working groups, mainly shelter and WASH, and inter-agency meetings.
At the regional levels, in addition to municipalities and unions of municipalities, bureaus and representatives of government and international and UN agencies would constantly be engaged in the project processes, notably the Qaimmaqams (Heads of district/Caza leading the regional security cells), UNHCR and other international agencies regional offices. The project will also collaborate and complement on-going and recent UN initiatives in the targeted areas dealing with issues related to Syrian refugees.


The project will set up a model whereby unions of municipalities, municipalities, and communities are actively and constantly engaged in responding to the needs of the Syrian refugees. Partnerships with key local actors represent a core value for this project. The involvement of local actors will prevent possible bottleneck situations in the response, as it will not be limited to agencies already concerned with overstretched capacities.

Pour se faire, il s'articule autour de trois des piliers de la stratégie : 
-	Promotion du dialogue démocratique : à travers le renforcement de capacité des structures communautaires qui canalisent les discours communautaires, la sensibilisation des communautés sur la gestion de la RFO et la résolution pacifique des conflits, l'instauration des mécanismes communautaires de prévention et résolution des conflits ;
-	Restauration de l'autorité de l'Etat : grâce à l'amélioration de l'accès aux services administratifs essentiels, dont le déploiement des éléments formés de la PNC, l'amélioration de la situation socio-économique, sécuritaire et sociale induite de la réhabilitation de la route par la méthode HIMO, l'appui matériel et techniques aux institutions judiciaires ;
-	Réinsertion, réintégration et relance économique : en créant des débouchés économiques pour les groupes à risques (femmes chefs de ménages, femmes vulnérables, femmes des policiers et des militaires, populations autochtones), en améliorant le secteur agricole et les activités génératrices de revenus comme sources de moyens de subsistance. 

La composante UNHABITAT de ce projet vise à toucher directement 10,000 ménages (y compris des ménages-femmes) de la zone bénéficiant des activités de prévention et de résolution de conflit à travers les plateformes de dialogue communautaire. La minorité autochtone (pygmée) sera représentée dans les plateformes de dialogues par un nombre minimum de représentant et bénéficiera également des activités génératrices des revenus. Bien plus, les organisation communautaires, notamment 3 antennes de la CFI, 10 Comités locaux d'éveil, 5 Comités locaux de gestion des ressources naturelles RFO, 12 maisons de femmes et 10 organisations féminines, bénéficieront des activités de formation pour les rendre plus efficaces dans la sensibilisation sur le droit foncier et les méthodes alternatives des conflits fonciers, ainsi que, pour les antennes de la CFI seulement,  dans la prise en charge des conflits fonciers. De façon indirecte, c'est toute la population de la zone d'intervention (Mambasa, Epulu, Niania), environ 25,000 ménages, qui sera touchée, ainsi que le  Gouvernement provincial et de district avec une meilleure représentation, un fonctionnement et une qualité de service améliorés, particulièrement au niveau des chefferies du territoire de Mambasa et de l'administration foncière. 

La logique d'intervention et le séquençage des activités dans le projet est très important et doit se baser sur la mise en place d'un dialogue communautaire visant à identifier les conflits au niveau de la communauté et entre les communautés et de développer toute une série d'activités autour de ces plateformes de dialogue afin de résoudre ces conflits directement ou indirectement. 

 A cet effet les activités du pilier dialogue démocratique seront mises en œuvre en premier sur une période d'au moins 3 mois afin de documenter les conflits pour ensuite préparer la représentation de ces communautés. Les activités sous les piliers RAE et RRR se baseront sur les résultats du dialogue et de ce fait démarreront en principe après les 3 mois initiaux. Néanmoins ; certaines activités préparatoires seront mis en œuvre dès le début de projet. 

La promotion du dialogue démocratique se fera à travers d'une part des structures existantes d'identification et de médiation de conflit qui ont été mises en place par le Réseau Haki na Amani (RHA), il s'agit des Comités Locaux d'éveil (CLE).

The
overall goal of the project is to improve the livelihoods of urban marginalized
youth. This will through normative and programmatic activities enhance their
inclusion in governance, access to financial resources, and provision of
training and information through dedicate urban space. The project will utilize
an integrated approach that will focus on critical interventions to strengthen
the capacity of youth, local governments and strategic partner institutions to
address urban youth issues.

There are two main expected accomplishments
(intermediate outcomes):

Improved
livelihoods for marginalised youth in urban slums

Improved inclusion of young people in governance
issues at all levels.



There are four
sub-expected accomplishments (immediate outcomes):



Increased
access to financial resources by marginalised youth. 

Increased number of urban youth centres and training of
youth in targeted cities.

 Increased
knowledge and sensitization of national local authorities in targeted countries
on matters of youth.

 Enhanced engagement of strategic partners (national, local,
civil society, private sector and youth organizations) on matters of youth.

To address the lack of information amongst planners and decision makers on the key mobility challenges confronting their cities, the project will develop, field-test and disseminate a ""RapidAssessment Tool"". Quick-Impact field projects will be implemented in 3-4 target cities. These will highlight how simple but innovative intervention such as design of selected streets as shared spaces that fulfill space and linking functions can improve mobility outcome for citizens and businesses. Based on the Project and previous work done by the Urban Basic Services Branch, collaboration will also be sought with the International Financial Institutions, with a view to supporting target cities in securing financing for medium and long-term mobility investments.
To achieve and maintain sustainable patterns of mobility, cities require to put in placeappropriate regulatory and institutional arrangements. While ""ideal"" and ""comprehensive"" arrangements can take a long time to be established, incremental and quick - impact solutions can again be fruitful - for example a simple GIS based fleet database can make public bus services more efficient in many cities. Based on the results of the Rapid Assessment as mentioned above and through dialogue at the city and national level, this project will support two to three target cities in incrementally adopting a set of new institutional or regulatory arrangements that provide quick and visible benefits to citizens and businesses.
The project will benefit all city dwellers, particularly the poor. The commuting public,businesses of all sizes, transport service providers and freight and goods delivery services are amongst the main beneficiary groups who will benefit irom improvements in urban mobility. City dwellers as a whole will indirectly benefit irom improved air quality.

2.3 Project's Purpose 

Within the context of the challenges and innovative approaches described
earlier, the GRHS 2009 had identified promising trends and opportunities for
urban planning to be re-established as an effective tool for the management of
human settlement in the 21st century.

Opportunities exist for incorporating the informal sector contribution
in urban development, for responding to environmental concerns and to manage
the carbon footprint of cities and the risk and vulnerability to natural
disasters and conflicts, while at the same time ensuring that planning
contributes to managing the growth of cities and to providing shelter for their
inhabitants. 

The project will therefore contribute positively to a new paradigm of
urban/regional planning that is proactive, strategic, flexible, phased,
spatially integrated and linked with municipal-level budgeting and finance
systems, to contribute to sustainable urban development. 

Despite its aspirations, strategic planning is still regarded as too
complex and ineffective. There is still ample room to make it more appealing,
by documenting successes and providing simplified tools. In this context, it is
intended to develop simplified tools and to continue the revision of existing
ones, in order to best incorporate the principle of sustainability. Attention
to the participatory process around strategic planning will be maintained to
ensure its objectives are relevant for all groups, and particularly the urban
poor.

One way to disseminate new approaches will be via institutions of
education. The 2009 GRHS found that, in more than half of the world's
countries, not a single university offers a degree in urban planning, whereas
even in countries with established planning degrees the programmes may
emphasize the older ‘rational planning' model with little attention to current
trends and approaches. This programme component will help to address that gap
through partnerships with the international Association of Planning Schools.

An ultimate form of impact at the normative level will be achieved
through supporting countries in updating their national urban policies and urban
planning frameworks. The 2009 GRHS found that the planning frameworks in many
developing countries still reflect a colonial legacy; such laws and regulations
could be modified to facilitate the implementation of some of the new urban
planning approaches discussed above. Likewise multi-level planning systems may
feature overlapping responsibilities and lack coherence. UN-HABITAT will engage
where opportunities will be highest to influence ongoing reform processes,
however, it is aware that achieving results at this level may well take years,
and thus may not lie within the present programme component timeframe.

Urban planning at the neighbourhood and city level can play an important
role in promoting sustainable urban development and in contributing to improved
quality of life in the community. The project will pay particular attention to the
planning of urban expansions, and mechanisms for guiding land occupation
towards more orderly patterns, with higher densities and better proportions
between built-up and street space and wider landscape connectivity and
ecosystem functionality. 

The project will aim at filling several gaps at the normative and
operational levels, namely gaps in policy development and analysis, comparative
benchmarking, availability of good practices, capacity within national and
local actors, as well as institutionalized mechanisms for peer learning and
other forms of capacity building. 

The project strategy is
developed at 3 levels: 

At global level it will develop tools and
     guidance to support local action, reform and learning, including awareness
     materials, technical tools, documented case studies and analysis of good
     practices. At national level, it will work on national urban
     policies as well as to analyze planning frameworks as a way to identify
     opportunities for introducing innovations and engage in reform processes,
     and will work with key stakeholders for capacity building and awareness. At city level, it will develop pilot activities
     for implementation of planning initiatives and provide expertise on key
     urban planning issues to local governments and other stakeholders groups. 

A loop of feedback to gather
lessons learnt and develops policy inputs will also be nurtured from local to
global level.

This will promote sustainable housing system to contribute to address the two major global challenges - climate change mitigation and poverty reduction. The green initiative will mainly work in urban areas, with SMEs related to housing that will help to reduce GHG emission and other pollutants, enhancing resource efficiency through supporting market forces (i.e. producers, consumers and enablers including the government). The initiative intends to bring in state-of-art knowledge and skills from European countries and expects to promulgate the good practices in the region through networks of SWITCH Asia, IHS/Erasmus University, UN-Habitat and others. 

The project will address three aspects:
i) Creating enabling policy environment to promote sustainable housing 
ii) Strengthening supply chains for sustainable housing and building capacity of SMEs to deliver household level green technologies and services. 
iii) Stimulating consumer demand for sustainable housing;

In recent years, some SMEs have started to produce green products and services that are related to sustainable housing. Few SMEs like solar energy companies are trying to exploit the market prompted by the on-going energy crisis, while others have started producing and marketing products and services such as eco-housing, rain water harvesting, waste and wastewater recycling, hollow concrete blocks, soil cement blocks and passive energy design. However, these industries are still in their infancy and there are three major gaps in promoting sustainable housing - a) need to create an enabling environment by developing supportive policy frameworks and incentives for the SMEs and consumers, b) need to strengthen the supply chain of the SMEs to ensure smooth supply of quality products at a competitive price, and c) social marketing campaign to increase consumer education on availability of the products and services and their importance. Moreover, skilled human resource is yet other hurdles to flourish this emerging business. 
As sustainable housing involves large number of stakeholders, there is a need to bring together different stakeholders for this common cause. This project will bring together Nepalese SMEs and their associations as intermediary organizations, government agencies such as Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD) and Department of Urban Development and Building Construction (DUDBC), municipalities, NGOs involved in the sector and financing institutions such as Town Development Fund. NGOs, such as Clean Energy Nepal (CEN), Environment and Public Health Organization (ENPHO) and Shelter and Local Technology Development Centre (SLTDC), which have experience in research and promotion of energy efficient building, water and waste management, can play an important role in building local capacity. Similarly, Intermediary organisations such as associations of SMEs including Federation of Nepalese Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FNCCI) and Nepal Land and Housing Development Association (NLHDA) can play an important role in mobilizing SMEs. Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies (IHS), Netherlands, a world leader in research and training related to sustainable housing, will provide its technical expertise and also assist in improving existing local technologies and innovations, as well as in learning from the European experience in this sector. UN-Habitat is therefore partnering with all these institutions to put forth a strong and multi-disciplinary team to implement this project. UN-Habitat will also utilize its own in-house expertise and experiences from projects such as “Promoting Energy Efficiency in Buildings in Africa” which it is implementing in five countries in Sub-Saharan Africa with support from Global Environment Facility (GEF). 
Limited market is the main barrier to sustainable housing contributed by lack of product information to consumers, skilled human resource and conducive policy environment. Therefore there is a need of easing the supply chain. As several of the conventional housing products are imported limited jobs are created locally, providing less economic opportunities to the poor. The sector workers need skill training for quality service and better link to specialized job market. Similarly, practicing architects/engineers can compete in the market by providing energy efficient and cost effective sustainable housing solutions to their clients. Information gap on available green products and services make them compromise on conventional products. The government offices are overburdened by their daily rituals and need support to upscale the sector. From the beneficiary side, there is huge gap on understanding the importance of green products and services. Many conventional products and services are not only unsustainable but uneconomical, and yet people are still relying on those mainly in the absence of consumer awareness.

(i) Improvement of quality of urban statistical information and data, especially on those regarding urban inhabitants with focus on gender issues, infrastructure development, basic services, housing profile, land use, migration, pollution, and environment etc. 
(ii) Enhancing capacity of GSO and UDA's officers and statisticians to coordinate among government planning professionals, policy makers, researchers for analyzing and making use of urban statistical data and information for evidence-based planning frameworks, monitoring and evaluation, and socio-economic development strategies and policies.
Over the recent past, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in close cooperation with United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Bank (WB) has provided MPI through Government Statistical Office (GSO) with technical support for the formulation of the Vietnam Statistics Development Strategy (VSDS) for the period 2011-2020 and a Vision 2030. UNFPA has also provided GSO with support for capacity building to GSO's statisticians to conducting the national-wide 2009 Census on Population and Housing, and conducted the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) in close cooperation with United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).
In the period 2012 - 2016, UNFPA will continue to provide technical support in the production and dissemination of quality population data that will be used for policy researches and studies, planning, monitoring and evaluation of social and population strategies mainly at the national and regional levels, as well as assessing the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) committed to by the Government of Viet Nam. Almost all of technical support to date primarily focuses on population variables and the socio-economic sector in general. As the result, there is still a lack of statistical data and information that are in great need for urban development planning and long-term city socio-economic development strategies (CDS). 
UNFPA is an international development agency that promotes the right of every woman, man and child to enjoy a life of health and equal opportunity. UNFPA supports countries in using population data for policies and programmes to reduce poverty and to ensure that every pregnancy is wanted, every birth is safe, every young person is free of HIV/AIDS, and every girl and woman is treated with dignity and respect.
With its rich experience in providing support for countries on population and development, UNFPA is an important partner providing technical assistance to MPI (through GSO) in producing and disseminating population statistics information and data for evidence based policy development and monitoring of the implementation of socio-economic development plans.
Engaging in this project, UNFPA can provide statisticians and selected officers of MPI and government agencies at different levels with technical support to build capacity and skills in producing and publishing data of national surveys as well as studies on specific emerging issues, sharing international experience, analyzing policies, improving capacity in monitoring policy implementation towards the implementation of Plan of Actions of International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) and MDGs.
UNFPA's comparative advantages are compatible with the action plans of GSO implementing VSDS 2011-2020; integrating population dynamics into development planning, and study on impact of the relationship between population and development to provide evidence for the development, implementation and monitoring of the National Socio-Economic Development Strategy 2011-2020 at national and local levels. In the years to come, UNFPA plans to continue providing technical support for integrating population variables into socio-economic development plans. 
With the profession in various areas of statistical work, including the training programmes for statisticians at different levels, UNFPA have and continue making a significant contribution to strengthening the statistical system for population variables. It would also benefit UN-Habitat for strengthening urban statistical data and information through making use of the established system and more skillful human resources through working in partnership with UNFPA for the project on “Support for the implementation of the Vietnam Statistical Development Strategy in the period 2011-2020 
It will be therefore strategic to provide MPI through GSO with technical support in coordination with UNFPA as it would basically enable UN-Habitat to make best use of the cadre of statisticians who have been and being trained by UNFPA under the 5-year project jointly supported by UN-Habitat and UNFPA, and the statistical systems already set up and operating for several years. More importantly, when being a part of the national statistics systems, urban statistics data and information will formally have the legal effect that would be in great need for government policy makers and planning professionals as they need for formalized sources of data and information. 
In consideration of the limited amount each UN agency may apply for from the One Plan Fund for September 2012 allocation round, this proposed proposal is developed to cover the first year's planned activities of the 5-year Project 2012 – 2016 entitled “Support for the implementation of the Vietnam Statistics Development Strategy in the period 2011-2020 and utilization of population information in development planning and programming” jointly developed by UN-Habitat and UNFPA and has been formally approved by the Government of Vietnam under ONE PLAN 2012 – 2016 (reference to Annex 3- Official Letter No. 1026/TTg-QHQT dated 19 July 2012 of the Prime Minister to approve the project). 
To focus on strengthening urban observatory and statistical systems, UN-Habitat's one-year project falls under ONE PLAN Focus Area 1, Output 1.1.1: “Strengthened capacities of data producers, providers and users for evidence-based socio-economic development planning and decision-making”.
The rationale for UN-Habitat to provide MPI with support in which GSO (under MPI) as the National Implementing Partner (NIP), and the Urban Development Agency (under Ministry of Construction) as the Co-implementing Partner (CIP) is based on the followings: 
(i) The ever-growing need for improved quality information and data for urban planning, developing policies and investments, and monitoring and evaluation; 
(ii) At the institutional level: it is the roles and responsibilities of MPI/GSO as the lead government agency in collecting statistical data and information, and coordinating with relevant sectors and ministries to integrate respective objectives and indicators into the national annual and five-year socio-economic development plans while the urban development sector is in the roles and mandate of the Urban Development Agency (UDA);
(iii) At the policy level: by end of the successful project implementation, the project will positively support the on-going perfection of the statistics systems to support the reform process of evidence-based urban planning frameworks. A more evidence-based and multi-sector planning process will, in turn, fill out deficiencies in the current urban planning approach that often does not factor the value and force of market dynamics, and functional on the assumption that a state can plan and induce development.

Based on the problem-what is
     the purpose of this project? Therefore, the hereby proposed
     project represents the UN-Habitat contribution to what should become a
     longer and more comprehensive effort leading to the reinforcement of the
     national capacity for proper urban planning and development. The project
     will complement the on-going Participatory
     Slum Upgrading Programme (PSUP), a global UN-Habitat initiative
     currently in its second phase of implementation, and will serve as
     preparatory work to the UN-Habitat proposal to the Innovative Fund of the Millennium
     Challenge Account - Zambia (MCAZ), which is expected to open in August
     2013.The
     aim of this proposal is to assist the GRZ and the LCC in building adequate
     institutional capacity at both central and local levels regarding urban
     planning, especially concerning city extensions. This includes the support to the development of a robust urban
     policy and regulatory framework for Zambia and the Lusaka city in
     particular. Residents
     living in unplanned settlements will benefit directly through improved city
     planning which is expected to lead to reduced overcrowding, adequate water
     supply, and improved environmental conditions, improved sanitation, good
     drainage, scheduled collection of solid waste and more importantly secured
     land tenure and adequate housing for most of the population and continued
     improvement in environmental conditions. Through
     participatory planning processes in which not only government officials at
     National and City levels are consulted but residents of unplanned
     settlements are also consulted through their Residents Development
     Committees' (RDC) which are the recognized community based organisations
     that represent their interests.By
     building GRZ and the LCC in urban planning, especially concerning city
     extensions including providing support to the development of a robust
     urban policy and regulatory framework for Zambia and the Lusaka city in
     particular. Proposed
     solutions: 

(i) Reinforce
Institutional capacity regarding urban
planning, especially regarding city extensions and urban densification, in
Lusaka.

(ii) Promote Inter-sectorial coordination and
multi-stakeholder dialogue to start developing a National Urban Policy.

Who
     are the possible partners internal and external that will help in

Based on the problem-what is
     the purpose of this project? Therefore, the hereby proposed
     project represents the UN-Habitat contribution to what should become a
     longer and more comprehensive effort leading to the reinforcement of the
     national capacity for proper urban planning and development. The project
     will complement the on-going Participatory
     Slum Upgrading Programme (PSUP), a global UN-Habitat initiative
     currently in its second phase of implementation, and will serve as
     preparatory work to the UN-Habitat proposal to the Innovative Fund of the Millennium
     Challenge Account - Zambia (MCAZ), which is expected to open in August
     2013.The
     aim of this proposal is to assist the GRZ and the LCC in building adequate
     institutional capacity at both central and local levels regarding urban
     planning, especially concerning city extensions. This includes the support to the development of a robust urban
     policy and regulatory framework for Zambia and the Lusaka city in
     particular. Residents
     living in unplanned settlements will benefit directly through improved city
     planning which is expected to lead to reduced overcrowding, adequate water
     supply, and improved environmental conditions, improved sanitation, good
     drainage, scheduled collection of solid waste and more importantly secured
     land tenure and adequate housing for most of the population and continued
     improvement in environmental conditions. Through
     participatory planning processes in which not only government officials at
     National and City levels are consulted but residents of unplanned
     settlements are also consulted through their Residents Development
     Committees' (RDC) which are the recognized community based organisations
     that represent their interests.By
     building GRZ and the LCC in urban planning, especially concerning city
     extensions including providing support to the development of a robust
     urban policy and regulatory framework for Zambia and the Lusaka city in
     particular. Proposed
     solutions: 

(i) Reinforce
Institutional capacity regarding urban
planning, especially regarding city extensions and urban densification, in
Lusaka.

(ii) Promote Inter-sectorial coordination and
multi-stakeholder dialogue to start developing a National Urban Policy.

The purpose of the CBMSP is to create “Self-Sustained Municipalities
capable of effective, efficient and accountable delivery of public services”.
All the National Priority Programmes (NPP) incorporate three principal
approaches: 



1. Prioritized reform initiatives

2. Selected institution building

3. Improving and increasing direct services to the population



The CBMSP will be achieved, and is pursuing a three-pronged approach
with development interventions in the following fields: 



(i) Policy Support at National
Level to Independent Directorate for Local Governance (IDLG) to
incorporate lesson learnt (revenues, budgeting, community participation, and
service delivery) into operational instructions and manuals which can
facilitate the expansion of the CBMSP to other municipalities. For the Ministry
of Urban Development Affairs (MUDA) support is proposed in the field of
Strategic Municipal Action Planning and settlement upgrading and regularization
to let the Ministry take the role of enabler in assisting the Municipalities
and Communities to plan and manage urban development. Local Level support will be given to the Municipal Advisory Boards (MAB)
and Mayor how best to interact with communities and let communities (especially
women, youth and vulnerable groups) participate in decision making and apply
principles of good governance.



(ii) Organisational Development and Capacity Building of Municipalities
so that Local Governments can undertake revenue collection, budgeting,
planning, design and supervise the implementation of infrastructure projects
(including maintenance), conduct Monitoring and Evaluation of Municipal
activities and reporting. Organisational Development is basically applying good
management practices, how to get things done, while Capacity Building is
focussing on developing human resource development, equipping staff with the
understanding and skills and the access to information and knowledge to enable
them to perform effectively.



(iii) Service Delivery by Communities and Municipalities. To enhance the
trust between the citizens and local government and make that the project will
have concrete deliverables and also facilitate on-the-job learning process
Municipal level block grants will be made available and will be allocated when
approved by the steering committee. The projects at the community level will be
managed and monitored by community representatives with guidance and
consultation of the municipality, while the city level projects will be managed
and monitored by the municipality and MAB.

The project aims at raising the profile of urbanization as an imperative for development in Africa. It will contribute towards promoting democratic governance through mobilization, sensitization and strengthening the non-state actors to partner effectively with sub-Sahara African governments in articulating Africa's priorities for the next 20 years with focus on; Urban planning for streets and common spaces, youths and urban job creation, urban inequalities and poverty, governance and the role of non-state actors including private sector, research and knowledge institutions.




Project implementation will entail practical and evidence – based research,
consultative workshops, policy dialogues and capacity building for key
partners' networks and government officials who are engaged with driving the
urban agenda. It specifically addresses the current disconnection between state
and non-state actors, and seeks to build collaboration and complementarity
around agreed priorities and promote support for them at the national and
global levels. The project focuses on strengthened partnerships in identifying,
formulating and promoting sustainable urbanization with the identified
components as pillars for programme implementation.

The participants – HAPs and selected officers of national governments benefit directly by participating in all planned expert group meetings, validation workshops, policy dialogues and training sessions. They will contribute directly to the priority identification and formulation of strategies. They will benefit from the networking and exchanges of experiences, all backstopped by UN-Habitat expertise at the headquarters and at country level. They will be equipped with knowledge of current challenges of urbanization and what their roles are in addressing them.
Currently, HAPs are disjointed and dissatisfied with programmes of governments in urban planning. They are also displeased that UN-Habitat policies concerning them have not been systematic and coordination has been inadequate. The project provides an opportunity to strengthen the position of HAPs in their countries with technical support from UN-Habitat. It also offers UN-Habitat the opportunity to streamline its engagement with its partners especially as Habitat III.



The
representatives of HAPs would be trained and involved in validating the
priorities through their participation in supporting the preparation of the
national reports on Habitat III, validate research findings at sub-regional level,
and further equipped with conceptual skills required to promote the new vision
of UN-Habitat as it strengthens the New African Urban Agenda. They will in turn
be more effective actors at their neighborhood, and influence policies at the
local and national levels in partnership with their municipalities and national
governments. 




This project aims to build an understanding between non-state actors and national governments, thereby building an African consensus with a strong momentum of support for a continent-wide urban agenda for the next 20 years. The project will build collaboration and complementarity between state and non-state actors through inclusive and participatory preparation for the post 2015 agenda and national reports for Habitat III.
The proposed solutions are the most appropriate ways of raising a critical awareness which is required to drive the Urban Agenda. CSOs often fail to make the connections between felt problems/disasters and lack systemic planning of the human settlement they live in. They further fail to appreciate the impact of certain types of policies on physical planning issues. This project seeks to build a strong balance for the urbanization tripod - of Government, CSOs including academia, and the private sector. The solutions are aimed at consensus building, thereby removing the mutual suspicion between state and non-state actors.
The partners include UN agencies working in the African region, African Union and related institutions, private sector operators and national governments.

The project aims at raising the profile of urbanization as an imperative for development in Africa. It will contribute towards promoting democratic governance through mobilization, sensitization and strengthening the non-state actors to partner effectively with sub-Sahara African governments in articulating Africa's priorities for the next 20 years with focus on; Urban planning for streets and common spaces, youths and urban job creation, urban inequalities and poverty, governance and the role of non-state actors including private sector, research and knowledge institutions.




Project implementation will entail practical and evidence – based research,
consultative workshops, policy dialogues and capacity building for key
partners' networks and government officials who are engaged with driving the
urban agenda. It specifically addresses the current disconnection between state
and non-state actors, and seeks to build collaboration and complementarity
around agreed priorities and promote support for them at the national and
global levels. The project focuses on strengthened partnerships in identifying,
formulating and promoting sustainable urbanization with the identified
components as pillars for programme implementation.

Stemming from the urban
development challenges exhaustively studied by UN-Habitat and its Regional
Office for Africa, the purpose of this project is to conceive and implement innovative
and demand-driven urban planning activities in Sub-Saharan African cities.
Under the general framework of Compact, Connected, Integrated and Inclusive
Cities (CCIIC), there is a need for cities that optimize demographic and economic
densities, privilege proximity among economic activities and people within a predominantly mixed
land-use pattern; cities that are socially diverse and multi-functional.
Densification and extension plans aim to expand available urban space, while increasing
residential and economic densities through the creation of compact communities,
the e guiding of new redevelopment to areas which are better suited for
urbanization, and the creation of sufficient public space to sustain urban
development in future, thus contributing to a more efficient and sustainable
development.

Despite the onus placed on the
urban planner's role, this project will allow UN-Habitat and its partners to
fully engage with local, regional and national government competences. Capacity
building should come with missions aiming at changes in organizational
structures, development of skills, streamlining of mandates and
responsibilities, as well as improvements in resource allocation. Insofar as
delivery processes are concerned, the different projects UN-Habitat aims to
propose will attempt to move away from the dominantly technical approach, and
disinhibit local initiatives and endogenous development. The critical
requirement is to revitalize local assets, engage with local stakeholders,
harness and deploy resources and potentialities among communities and
neighborhoods. Urban planning and spatial design will be brought forward with a
particular attention to the needs of the urban poor, a population that will
predictably be rising in Africa in the coming years. Closing the socioeconomic
urban divide is the key to the sustainability of African cities, which will
also come through meaningful and specific investments in slum upgrading
programs. 

This necessity for UN-Habitat to
interact with communities, develop locally adapted tools, and include
vernacular planning traditions will directly benefit target populations. In the
context of efficient planning for slum-prevention, the priority will be to
provide target populations with effective tools for a well-planned city.

The project will also catalyse
the establishment of a Global Urban Planning Facility that could follow a
similar approach, in response to the growing demand for sound planning support,
which stems from the success of the advocacy and awareness work of UN-Habitat.
This facility will build on the normative and pilot work of other Programmes
(ASUD and Urban Planning for Sustainable Development) in terms of tools and
approaches, as well as networks of expertise, and respond to a diversity of
needs in urban planning stemming from cities and countries (through this
project) and from other development partners.

The purpose of this project is to address four main areas, that
     concur to increased vulnerability to the effects of natural disasters:
     

o
Lack of capacities and structured experiences in
addressing urban risk, reduce risks
and build resilience in cities frequently affected by natural disasters in
Mozambique, Malawi and Madagascar;

o
Lack of capacities of the National Disaster
Institutions to capitalize and
structure the many good practices implemented, which results in huge losses of
resources

o
Lack of harmonized practices at the regional level and low level of mutual learning among countries that
share the same hazards and risks

o
Weak capacities of communities in human settlements in
Mozambique to build safely and
rebuild with improvement or retrofitting better houses and community
infrastructure (i.e. schools). The focus on Mozambique for this aspect is due
to a direct request of ECHO, in response to cyclone Funso that affected
Mozambique in 2012.

UN-Habitat, in partnership with other UN agencies (and in
     particular FAO), is well placed to contribute in addressing the causes of
     the problems, thanks to 10 years of experience in DRR in the sub-region,
     established partnership and reputations at regional level via the upcoming
     DIMSUR Centre and presence in the 3 main countries of the action. It will:

o
develop the first
innovative Urban Risk and Resilience instrument in the sub-region, by engaging
experts, local governments and partners in the elaboration of the tool and in
its testing at city-level

o
document all
shelter, housing and infrastructure resistant practices hand-in-hand with the National
Institutions, so to publish do's and don'ts, which might be turned into
National Policies

o
provide technical
assistance and support data management to all DRR partners in its field of
expertise (Housing and Shelter; Land Tenure; Planning)

o
rebuild as
on-the-job training at least 15 community schools and 50 houses, hand-in-hand
with INGC and Ministry of Public Works to document the practice and include it
in the Disaster Contingency Planning of Mozambique



All priorities
have been established (Ref. assessments) along with the 4 categories of
beneficiaries this projects benefits, as detailed below



Given the
complexity of this context the problem can only by addressed by a broad
partnership of international actors, along with national to local authorities.
For this reason a technical partnership has been established, through the
DIPECHO III project at regional level among UN-Habitat, FAO, CARE and COOPI and
at national level in the 3 countries with a number of partnering UN agencies,
NGOs and the Red Cross. Then, this project has been designed in parallel with 3
other projects designed by FAO, CARE and COOPI in respective areas of
expertise, with a common overall logical framework and same areas of
intervention. 



Within this
partnership, UN-Habitat will provide high-level policy advisory services, along
with technical support and direct implementation to all categories of
beneficiaries and to its partners.



The purpose of
this project will therefore be to:Ensuring the
capitalization along with National to Local authorities in the 3 countries of
DRR/M practices on Housing and Basic Community Infrastructure resistant to
Disaster, so to take stock and transform practices into policies. (In common
log-frame with FAO, COOPI, CARE); IMPORTANT:

The overall objective of JPGL II is to promote
improvements in local governance quality that can contribute to peace
consolidation, development and equitable service delivery. For JPLG's overall
objective to be realised, a number of agents
will have to
promote change that
can alter the
status quo in
a direction that
fosters a stronger, more
responsive and accountable
compact between the
state and its
citizens in the
provision of service delivery.
Despite progress the
current context is
still characterised by
limited trust in
government structures at both central and local levels, which in turn
means that their legitimacy is often contested.
This can increase the
risk of a
return to instability
and conflict. Moreover, the political space is still limited especially in southern areas, where
radical groups restrict the voice of many, including women. There is thus
a need
to consolidate and
enlarge the space
for non-state actors
in the rest
of Somalia and
to restore a healthy and accountable state citizen
nexus. 



To achieve the overall objective of JPLG II, the
programme outcomes are structured around three mutually reinforcing
strategies: 



1. Supporting policy and legislative reforms for
functional, fiscal and administrative decentralization that clarify and enhance
the role of local government, its relationship to central government, and as a
means to improve local service delivery.



Outcome 1 will focus on policy
and legal frameworks across Somalia
and is initially designed to address weaknesses in current laws on
decentralization in Somaliland and
Puntland. These provide an incomplete
account of the responsibilities and functions to be devolved to local
government, ignore the fiscal implications and lack supporting regulations for
implementation. These issues need to be
clarified in order to resolve disputes between central line agencies and
districts, and to provide a stronger foundation for local governments to move forward; 



2. Improving local government capacity for
equitable service delivery.



Outcome 2 aims to address the
weak capacity of most local authorities in Somalia by providing a
comprehensive package of training and technical support covering basic elements
of local administration. It also seeks
to improve coordination between
districts and the
centre in planning
and programming to ensure
better consistency and use
of resources. A third output is concerned with increasing
locally generated revenues and strengthening the role and coverage of the LDF;
and, 



1.
Improving
and expanding the delivery of sustainable services to citizens in an equitable,
responsive and socially accountable manner and promoting local economic
environment.



Outcome 3 focuses on improving
the delivery of local services. This is
to be achieved by collaborating more closely with central line
departments, engaging more
directly with non-state
providers, and enhancing
the accountability of local governments to their constituents. Another
element relates to strengthening the local economy, promoting private
investment and enterprise, and creating more and better job opportunities. 



In all of these efforts, JPLG II recognizes the
paramount importance of respecting and promoting local ownership, commitment
and leadership. Without these ingredients,
the prospects of sustaining gains are substantially diminished. For this purpose, JPLG II will continue seek
support and political commitment at the highest
levels of Government,

The purpose is to undertake the PILaR global pilot as a learning exercise both for the city of Medellin and Colombia as well as for UN-Habitat in order to learn how to support member states and municipalities to do PILaR. Through this project, the municipality may be able to shift and rapidly address its high rates of informality and deprivation therefore achieving a more sustainable urban development. 
Land readjustment is a technique whereby a group of neighboring landowners in an urban-fringe area are combined in a partnership for the unified planning, servicing and subdivision of their land with the project costs and benefits being shared between the landowners. 
The benefits of land readjustment are vast for urban development. The attraction of land readjustment for landowners is that they can develop their property and get value gains from urbanization. For local governments, it ensures efficient urbanization of land at reduced cost because the project site and infrastructure rights of way do not have to be purchased or compulsorily acquired. The cost of the infrastructure and subdivision can be financed with a short/medium-term loan which, depending on the land contribution ratio of participating landowners, may be repaid through the sale of some of the new building plots. 
However, for land readjustment approach UN-Habitat is proposing to bear fruits, there needs to be a conducive legal framework, professional capability to manage the process and a genuine commitment to stakeholder and community engagement, which is often lacking in developing countries. Other limitations may include that the land may take many years to be developed and occupied, whereas the government's objective is to achieve early development and a flow of revenues. Another limitation is that the ability of land readjustment projects to engage with and provide access to land for lower-income groups is limited by the need to provide the original land owners with an increased value for the smaller plot areas they receive after land subdivision and servicing.
The Participatory and Inclusive Land Readjustment (PILaR) aims at enabling Medellin –and potentially developing countries– to use the land readjustment technique to undertake orderly and proactive city extension and densification in a pro-poor, participatory and gender-responsive manner, empowering the municipalities to facilitate this process. UN-Habitat aims at introducing PILaR as a new service for national governments and local authorities to better tackle urbanization challenges, such as urban sprawl and the slums, through a rights-based approach where participation and inclusivity will be central. 
The project aims therefore at creating a conducive environment for PILaR in Medellin, Colombia: enhancing legislation, if needed, and building the capacity of the municipality in land readjustment and participatory processes. The project will also look at improving the supply of serviced urban land through orderly and negotiated process of PILaR (prior to investment phase). As a result of this project, an investment phase shall follow up creating a compact, well connected and inclusive neighborhood, if funding is available. 
If the project is done, a sound participatory process will have been carried out in the selected site and an overall agreement will be reached for its redevelopment which will create a more compact, well connected, inclusive and sustainable neighborhood. If the project is not done, the situation in Medellin may remain as it is now: a territory with challenges to densify its space in a quick and inclusive manner. Medellin and UN-Habitat would also miss a good opportunity of participatory methodology in redevelopment processes. 
The citizens of Medellin are expected to be the ultimate beneficiaries of this project (in particular those living and those that will end up living in the selected project site), including and with a particular focus on the most vulnerable. Once the project site is selected within the city, a community profile will be done, gathering data, including sex-disaggregated information.
The city of Medellin will directly benefit as it will gain knowledge and experienced on how to undertake PILaR for sustainable urban development together with UN-Habitat. The city can then use this knowledge gained in the selected pilot site to apply it to other sites in the city as soon as possible. Other beneficiaries include the Government of Colombia (Department of National Planning, Ministry of Housing, Cities and Territory), the private sector (including developers) benefiting from the densification of the site (and potentially the city), and community-based organizations that will learn how to engage and participate in a PILaR process and inclusive urban development. 
This project has four levels of intervention. The first level is the city, and the selected site in particular, where most of the learning and negotiations will occur. A second layer will be the national level which will be accompanying this process and learning from it for possible replication. The third level is the regional one, in Latin America, where other cities may be interesting in learning from this experience. Last but not least, the global level will develop the learning of this process, including with awareness materials, technical tools, documented case studies and analysis of good practices on both the criteria needed for succeeding with land readjustment and how it can be effectively undertaken. The city and the global levels are the most time and resource-intensive levels. Learning how to use land readjustment and experimenting PILaR will therefore be central to this innovate project. There will a refining through practice as all internal and external stakeholders learn from the pilot in Medellin.

The main purpose of this activity is the coordination of Small Island Developing States response to cities and other human settlements coping with climate change and sustainable land use, contributing to the participatory analysis of challenges faced by SIDS, to foster awareness building around the relevance of the mentioned topics and to the strengthening of SIDS position in the global debate on development. Detailed objectives related to the project expected accomplishments are:
· To share experiences and methodologies with regard to cities in SIDS facing climate change and land use constraints, land governance or land degradation.
· To strengthen partnerships between SIDS at national and city levels. 
· To discuss the rationale and contents of a possible sustainable urbanization goal that could be considered for inclusion in the ‘Post-2015 UN Development Agenda' as part of the post-Rio+20 ‘Sustainable Development Goals'.
· To sensitize SIDS countries on the SIDS Conference in Samoa in 2014 and the Habitat III Conference in 2016, in order that national and regional preparations can be undertaken and a common position can be discussed vis-à-vis the sustainability of cities in small islands environments.

The project also contributes towards several common global development objectives, facilitating relevant internal and external partnerships. AusAID, the main development partner of this project, has related strategic goals directly, to be addressed by this project:
· Sustainable Economic Development: reducing the impacts of climate change and other environmental factors through improved awareness of sustainable urbanisation, planning, land use to mitigate climate change and adapt to rising sea levels and changing climatic conditions
· Effective Governance: The Ministerial conference will seek to improve urban, and in particular land governance to deliver better services, improve security and enhance justice and human rights through sensitisation of key issues and ministerial commitment in the conference declaration.
· Humanitarian and disaster response: more effective preparedness to disasters and crises in SIDS countries through improves strategies and systems for disaster mitigation and prevention as part of improved urban planning and land management approaches. 

In order to reach SIDS countries in an effective way, strategic related external partners (other than the requesting partner) have been invited, such as the CARICOM and the Pacific Forum Secretariat, who shall work together with the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (HAP lead). For the technical support, universities will participate and support knowledge identification and management: University of South Pacific, University of West Indies and Griffith University, Australia. They shall be the lead organizations in monitoring follow-up after the project implementation. Other Universities may join in this role upon later confirmation. It is also expected that other Society sectors such as SIDS networks and NGOs are invited to participate and contribute to the project, such as SIDSnet, PacificSIDS, Blue Space Caribbean.

Other UN agencies have an important role as external partners, particularly the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs SIDS Unit, UNDP and UNEP. The United Nations has been assisting and extending cooperation to SIDS in their sustainable development efforts through the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States finalized at the Global Conference held in Barbados in 1994, known also as the Barbados Programme of Action (BPOA). This programme was reviewed and revamped at the five-year review held at the Twenty-second special session of the General Assembly in 1999, and the ten-year review held in Mauritius (10-14 January 2005). The latter outcome is known as the Mauritius Strategy for Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States (MSI). The UN-OHRLLS mandate from the General Assembly calls upon the Office to engage in advocacy and mobilization of international support and resources for the implementation of the Programme of Action for SIDS. 
During the Rio + 20 Conference, concern was raised upon the 5-year review of the Mauritius Strategy for Implementation (MSI+5) concluding that “SIDS have made less progress than most other groupings, or even regressed, in economic terms, especially in terms of poverty reduction and debt sustainability. Sea-level rise and other adverse impacts of climate change continue to pose a significant risk to SIDS and their efforts to achieve sustainable development and for many represent the gravest of threats to their survival and viability, including for some through the loss of territory[1]”. As a result, the need for enhanced and continued support from the UN System was stressed and the assembling of the Third International Conference on SIDS in 2014 was recommended. Both recommendations were endorsed by the General Assembly and the SIDS Conference is expected to take place in Samoa in September 2014. 

Even though the Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean will take the lead, the whole project has been continuously discussed and coordinated with the Urban Planning and Design Branch, as well as with the Urban Legislation, Land and Governance Branch, providing the necessary source for high-level policy advice but also for knowledge management and advocacy.

The main purpose of this activity is the coordination of Small Island Developing States response to cities and other human settlements coping with climate change and sustainable land use, contributing to the participatory analysis of challenges faced by SIDS, to foster awareness building around the relevance of the mentioned topics and to the strengthening of SIDS position in the global debate on development. Detailed objectives related to the project expected accomplishments are:
· To share experiences and methodologies with regard to cities in SIDS facing climate change and land use constraints, land governance or land degradation.
· To strengthen partnerships between SIDS at national and city levels. 
· To discuss the rationale and contents of a possible sustainable urbanization goal that could be considered for inclusion in the ‘Post-2015 UN Development Agenda' as part of the post-Rio+20 ‘Sustainable Development Goals'.
· To sensitize SIDS countries on the SIDS Conference in Samoa in 2014 and the Habitat III Conference in 2016, in order that national and regional preparations can be undertaken and a common position can be discussed vis-à-vis the sustainability of cities in small islands environments.

The project also contributes towards several common global development objectives, facilitating relevant internal and external partnerships. AusAID, the main development partner of this project, has related strategic goals directly, to be addressed by this project:
· Sustainable Economic Development: reducing the impacts of climate change and other environmental factors through improved awareness of sustainable urbanisation, planning, land use to mitigate climate change and adapt to rising sea levels and changing climatic conditions
· Effective Governance: The Ministerial conference will seek to improve urban, and in particular land governance to deliver better services, improve security and enhance justice and human rights through sensitisation of key issues and ministerial commitment in the conference declaration.
· Humanitarian and disaster response: more effective preparedness to disasters and crises in SIDS countries through improves strategies and systems for disaster mitigation and prevention as part of improved urban planning and land management approaches. 

In order to reach SIDS countries in an effective way, strategic related external partners (other than the requesting partner) have been invited, such as the CARICOM and the Pacific Forum Secretariat, who shall work together with the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (HAP lead). For the technical support, universities will participate and support knowledge identification and management: University of South Pacific, University of West Indies and Griffith University, Australia. They shall be the lead organizations in monitoring follow-up after the project implementation. Other Universities may join in this role upon later confirmation. It is also expected that other Society sectors such as SIDS networks and NGOs are invited to participate and contribute to the project, such as SIDSnet, PacificSIDS, Blue Space Caribbean.

Other UN agencies have an important role as external partners, particularly the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs SIDS Unit, UNDP and UNEP.

The draft Operational Coordination Plan details these communities further and clarifies how many are covered by Detailed Outline Plans. As the development pressure on Area C is increasing, it is important to accelerate the planning effort and to address the serious planning backlog, as evidenced by the large amount of demolition orders and/or stop work orders issued.

Furthermore it is essential that affected village councils are fully aware of the need for planning; the risks involved and, are as such, in a position to engage with the Israeli Civil Administration (ICA) to negotiate the approval of their plans on behalf of their communities. It is important also that they are in position to guide the implementation of the plans. 
Until now, most planning efforts were led by IPCC, a local NGO. If the intent is to seriously scale up the planning support to Palestinian Communities in Area C. This means that, apart from IPCC who played a key role in piloting planning in Area C and in supporting Village Councils in their negotiations with the Israeli Civil Administration, other capacity will need to be mobilized. Recently, private sector firms have been contracted to prepare five lots of plans for Area C. Coordinating all ongoing initiatives will require capacity to support Village Councils ensuring proper community participation and ownership, coherence and exchange of lessons learnt, quality control and support in the negotiations with the ICA. 
Currently, the engagement with the ICA on the approval of plans is not structured. The situation on the ground and the impact of plans is also not properly documented. Better monitoring is needed with improved information sharing as parties are seeking a common ground in terms of numbers and progress made. 
Apart from reducing the risk of displacement, by creating a planning framework that helps to overcome standing demolition or stop work orders, the main reasons to prepare Detailed Outline Plans is to guide concrete improvements in the living conditions of Palestinian Communities in Area C. So far, there is insufficient link between the efforts in planning and investment initiatives.
Therefore the project will build upon existing initiatives and other systems and approaches that have a proven record of success, while also incorporating the challenges and lessons-learned into its actions moving forward. For example, a good source of knowledge includes the International Peace and Cooperation Centre, which has played a leading role in providing planning support to Palestinian Communities in Area C. After many years working in the area, it has now built up a solid base of experience in engaging and supporting Palestinian communities, ensuring their ownership of the planning process, in their interaction with the ICA. Indeed, IPCC is at the forefront of developing relevant planning approaches and it is well-placed to help build the capacity of the Palestinian private sector in relation to planning. Moreover, the close relationship of UN-Habitat and IPCC demonstrates the basis of lessons-learned in the formation of the logic of this intervention.

Further, UN-Habitat's played a strategic role in the development of the Strategic Action Plan since September 2009, jointly reviewing with relevant civil society organisations, OCHA, UNSCO and the Quartet, how planning could be made more effective to prevent displacement and facilitate local development of Palestinian Communities in Area C. These actions enhanced the understanding of the Agency in the issues faced in planning in this area of the world.

Finally, there was an explicit request from the Palestinian Authority to UN-Habitat to mobilize its planning expertise in Area C, to provide a link with the broader work of the UN on the topic, both at the humanitarian, development and political level and to facilitate the advocacy work by the international community.

The long-term objective is to address the land information requirements
of women and men living in slum communities and to build their capacity in the
use and application of the land information systems based on free and open
source software packages and in mainstreaming the thinking behind the continuum
of land rights in their community driven approaches like participatory
enumerations. This will form a basis for dialogue between local communities and
cities in negotiations for improving tenure security, inclusive planning and
enhancing access to basic services and infrastructure. 

The First Phase

The first phase of the project
has successfully pilot tested the
Social Tenure Domain Model in two informal settlements of the Municipality of
Mbale, Uganda and was integrated in the whole mapping and enumeration exercise
led by slum communities. The first phase was dovetailed to the existing project
initiative called Transforming the Settlements of the Urban Poor in Uganda (TSUPU)
by the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development (MoLHUD) of the
Government of Uganda as co-financed by Cities Alliance and partly being
implemented by Shack/Slum Dwellers International (SDI).



The first phase has also started the documentation of the process, the
dissemination of learning and experience and capacity building requirements
around its use and application. The previous project also conducted a training
of trainers on STDM use and application not only for Ugandan stakeholders but also
for other participants from other countries. The Project has also established a
regional learning center for STDM use and application which is intended for
future training activities and technical support. The pilot project was
highlighted in a Networking event on 04 September 2012 during the World Urban
Forum in Naples, Italy.

The project seeks to address the gaps and deficiencies
in planning process (tools, parameters, indicators, standards and approaches) at
the national and local level and support cities in developing strategic sustainable
urban development plans and implement demonstration projects for identified
priority issues and possible interventions. The emphasis of the project lies on testing the three legged approach in a range of fast growing cities in the Philippines, namely Cagayan De Oro, Iloilo and Siliay. In addition the project also applies the ASUD approach in Zamboanga which is the largest city in the South of Mindanao. This city's growth is primarily linked to the Bangsamoro peace process and the influx of internally displaced persons. Hence testing new urban planning principles (see project strategy) in a post crisis city is to complement the broader appraoch. 

Silay

Identified and prioritized
issues/challenges:

1. Urban
Economy: local asset and competitiveness not maximized (cultural heritage
site, international airport, gateway to other Negros cities.

2. DRRM and
CCA: relatively new in integrating DRRM measures into development plans and
investment plan.

3. Urban
Planning/Land: needs technical assistance on strategic urban planning,
including the identification of city extension areas and resettlement issues
(socialized and low-cost) especially in the context of the new airport in the
city

Possible
interventions:

1. Urban
Economy: preparation of master plan for eco-tourism (cultural heritage and
forest eco-tourism), and linking economic activities and skills to support
long-term tourism potentials, conduct of value chain analysis for local tourism
sector and formulation of local economic development strategy.

2. DRRM and
CCA: DRRM training for LGU personnel; mainstreaming DRRM concepts and tools
with LGU mandated plans.

3. Urban
planning: identification of new city extension areas and plan preparation; resettlement planning incorporating mobility and access to
livelihoods and employment; enhancement of CLUP and its implementation
considering the resistance of landowners in converting their lands to
commercial or mixed-uses.



Iloilo City

Identified and prioritized
issues/challenges:

1. Urban
economy: financing of urban development plan (e.g. housing; road and
mobility; transport; new developed areas; livelihoods) employment issues
especially on youth sector; reviving the urban economy of the city center
(issues on informality); enhancing and promoting business sector participation.

2. DRRM/CCA:
up-scaling issues on mainstreaming DRRM at the Barangay level.

3. Mobility:
inner-streets and walkability issues.

4. Planning/Land:
City extension development and urban renewal.

Possible
interventions:

1. Planning
and city extensions: As Iloilo is
relatively advanced in urban planning (compared to other Philippine cities) and
a beneficiary of numerous ODA on urban development, the city can serve as the
core for knowledge management development. Iloilo can play a resource city role
in documenting and sharing good and best practices vis-a-vis urban planning and
implementation. However, it still needs technical support for sustainable and
affordable city extensions/expansion for the new development areas; supporting
city extension planning or city center up-grading and low-cost housing
integrating mobility issues and access to livelihoods.

2. Urban
economy: skills development training
programme for youth employment complementing the LED strategy of the city,
targeting the unregulated sector.

3. DRRM/CCA:
complementing the city/JICA community-based DRRM programme.

4. Mobility:
pedestrian and street regulation/ re-adjustment, piloting small scale demo
project to support the city transport plan; training on mobility and
planning/regulation to promote walkable cities concept.



Butuan City

Identified and prioritized
issues/challenges:

1. DRRM/CCA:
capacity building on mainstreaming DRRM into local development plans and
policies.

2. Urban
planning: issues on drainage development and skills/knowledge on new city
approaches to sustainable urban development and expansion of new growth areas;
socialized housing.

3. Urban
economy: livelihood and employment issues amongst displaced timber industry
workers (approx. 3,000 displaced workers), need to identify and develop alternative
or complementing livelihoods for the displaced individuals and groups (timber
industry).

4. Land:
Land management and resettlement expansion to absorb informal and displaced
timber industry workers. Need for GIS to
rationalize lot parcels for improved real property tax generation and land use
planning.

Possible
interventions:

1. DRRM/CCA:
capacity building on DRRM and CCA planning tools; software or tools development
for “asset valuation” for DRRM planning; contingency planning and quick damage
quantification for post-disaster recovery planning and programming
(“preparedness for recovery”).

2. Urban
economy: support to displaced workers, reviving local economy/business to

Identified and prioritized
issues/challenges:

1. Urban
planning and land management: gaps on strategic urban planning tools and
knowledge and land re-adjustment.

2. DRRM/CCA:
capacity issues to mainstream CCA/DRRM measures into local plans and policies.

3. Mobility:
improved access of resettlement communities to urban services and livelihoods.

Possible
interventions:

1. Urban
planning: training on new concepts and city approaches on sustainable urban
development; continuation of ARCADIS technical assistance on integrated river
basin and flood management assessment and urban redevelopment of identified
blighted areas. Technical assistance in the preparation of spatial plan/design
for the identified urban extension area (Western Growth Node Area).

2. DRRM/CCA:
mainstreaming CCA/DRRM into local plans and policies (especially on identifying
and developing new growth areas and resettlement areas).

3. Mobility:
support to new relocation sites to ensure mobility and connectivity with the
overall city structure and services; pedestrian and street protection and
re-adjustment, training on land-use transport planning and mobility management.

4. Urban
Economy: livelihood support through skills training and employment support
especially among the typhoon-displaced communities.Manial - Estero de Paco

Identified and prioritized
issues/challenges:

Urban Planning: Urban environmental issues related to polluted estero (water way). Density and informal settlements.CCA/DRRM: Relocation and housing
     support for urban poor families (no tenure security) and those living in
     danger areas.Land: Need assistance on land management-
     maximization of land value and revenue generation for the city government.

Possible interventions:

1. Multi-stakeholder intervention (governance issue).The project also seeks to update national policies and planning
guidelines such as the National Urban Development and Housing Framework and the
City Shelter Planning Guidelines). Going
beyond the city's territorial jurisdiction and considering national priorities,
regional and cluster planning will also be promoted to respond to inter-LGU or
inter-city implementation on cross-boundary (e.g. ecological footprint or ecosystem-based
planning) and common urban development thematic concerns, including policy or
legislative reform agenda. 

As a pilot project, ASUD Philippines aims to ground-truth UN-Habitat's
new global program on sustainable urbanization (ASUD) and further enhance the
knowledge and practices as a collective and network of cities together with the
other four ASUD pilot countries (Colombia, Egypt, Rwanda and Mozambique).

The immediate
effect would be well planned cities and communities ready to implement spatial
and sectoral adjustments to its development plans taking into account urbanization,
economic development pace and risks. National government offices such as the urban
development and shelter agencies led by HUDCC and the DILG will benefit from
the updating of planning guidelines and sectoral development plans and frameworks.
Other LGUs will also benefit from models and learnings to be documented and shared.
UN-Habitat will provide the LGUs with policy guidance and technical assistance
on systems, tools and approaches covering the ASUD thematic areas.

The project seeks to address the gaps and deficiencies
in planning process (tools, parameters, indicators, standards and approaches) at
the national and local level and support cities in developing strategic sustainable
urban development plans and implement demonstration projects for identified
priority issues and possible interventions. The emphasis of the project lies on testing the three legged approach in a range of fast growing cities in the Philippines, namely Cagayan De Oro, Iloilo and Siliay. In addition the project also applies the ASUD approach in Zamboanga which is the largest city in the South of Mindanao. This city's growth is primarily linked to the Bangsamoro peace process and the influx of internally displaced persons. Hence testing new urban planning principles (see project strategy) in a post crisis city is to complement the broader appraoch. 

Silay

Identified and prioritized
issues/challenges:

1. Urban
Economy: local asset and competitiveness not maximized (cultural heritage
site, international airport, gateway to other Negros cities.

2. DRRM and
CCA: relatively new in integrating DRRM measures into development plans and

land policies, especially in Asia and Africa.
Often it is not possible for these countries to implement pro-poor and gender
sensitive land policies, because the underlying tools and practices do not always
exist, or have not been sufficiently documented and disseminated. Emerging from
the 1990s some organizations and individuals have been trying to address this
issue, but have struggled with the scale of the challenge geographically and
conceptually. In essence, most developing countries use conventional land
administration systems which cover less than 30 percent of the country, leaving
up to 70 percent of citizens looking to informal and/or customary approaches
for their tenure security. 



Prior to GLTN launch in 2006, an analysis was conducted which drew
several important conclusions. First,
while there are many examples of good land policies, there are few policies
that have been fully implemented due to lack of pro-poor, gender-sensitive and
large-scale land tools. Second, a
conclusion was that conventional land titling approaches have largely failed to
deliver their expected results: existing technical solutions are too expensive,
inappropriate for the range of tenure found in developing countries,
unsustainable financially or in terms of available capacity, and instead a
range of land tenure options is more appropriate. Third, an agreement was that land sector work in country cannot be
done at scale successfully in many countries without the combination of various
underlying factors and strategies including better donor coordination,
strengthening partnerships of key land actors, capacity development initiatives
and continuous dialogues and
communications between and amongst key stakeholders including government (at
various levels), professionals, civil society groups, academia/research
institutions, grassroots and target communities themselves. 



To address these
challenges, UN-Habitat has taken the lead and facilitated the establishment of
the Global Land Tool Network that aims at contributing to poverty reduction and
to the achievement of MDGs through the development of pro-poor and gender
sensitive land tools to improve tenure security of the urban and rural poor
since its launch in 2006. GLTN Phase 1 has already achieved significant results
in its 4 years of operations as concluded by the independent mid-term
evaluation and echoed by various partners and land actors. For example, there
is now a growing paradigm shift towards the adoption of a pro-poor, gender
sensitive and large scale land tools, policies and approaches; as well as the
recognition of the need for a ‘continuum of land rights' to replace the more
conventional approaches of reliance on cadastre and individual titles. Global
discourse on key GLTN's tools and approaches are well captured by various
global and regional interventions. Examples include the following: World Bank
is taking the lead in the development of Land Governance and Administration
Framework (LGAF) globally; FAO is taking the lead in the development and implementation
by member-states of the Voluntary Guidelines on Responsible Governance on Tenure of Land, Forests and
Fisheries, wherein UN-Habitat has played a critical role, the adoption of the
African Land Policy Framework and Guidelines which was supported and adopted by
the Third African Ministerial Conference on Housing and Urban Development (AMCHUD)
and the Bamako Action Plan. 



Moreover, Phase 1 has
already developed significant land tools and training packages ready for
rolling out with partners at national and local government levels.
Some partners are already adopting these land tools for their use and for their
capacity development initiatives. For example, the gender evaluation criteria
tool has now been adopted by Huairou Commission for their implementation and training
for trainers (ToTs) will be conducted before the end of the year. Likewise, the
International Land Coalition has indicated that they would like to adopt and
implement the same on their country-level projects in various countries. Training
for land professionals on this tool has also started. As part of GLTN Phase 2,
the gender evaluation criteria will also be introduced and mainstreamed in UN-Habitat
operations particularly in providing in-country support to tool implementation
in targeted countries and/or cities/municipalities and the needed capacity development initiatives
will be undertaken. The Kenya
experience in land policy formulation, donor coordination and engagement with
non-state actors has been used as a model for other country's interventions by
UN-Habitat (e.g. DRC, Eastern Caribbean Island
States, South Sudan and Liberia). GLTN
partners from the academia and training institutions are now adopting the land
tools developed, concepts and training packages in their training and
educational curriculum. For example, ITC-Netherlands is now teaching the
concept and use of the Social Tenure Domain Model (STDM) – a pro-poor land
rights recording system to their Masters' Program while the Technical
University of Munich has been mobilizing resources to adopt some GLTN training
packages for their curriculum as well as for conducting the same training
sessions. GLTN's partnership with grassroots organizations has also yielded
some significant successes. Aside from understanding the underlying reasons why
good grassroots land projects have difficulties in going to scale, specific
experiences like that of Brazil resulted in the regularization of an estimated
55,000 slum dwellers.



While significant results have been achieved by GLTN Phase 1, a great
deal more work is required for gains made to be consolidated and extended. GLTN
Phase 2 will further expand its partnership and scope from its known
international partners to UN-Habitat staff and selected land programmes/projects.
It will also implement some of its priority land tools in targeted countries
and/or cities/municipalities in partnership with UN-Habitat's field projects
and/or international partners with their national and local networks,
particularly in regard to the agencies new priority areas of urban land,
legislations and governance. GLTN Phase 2, in close collaboration with UN-Habitat's
regional offices and field operations, and other partners will ensure that
in-country interventions will be within the framework of ‘One UN System' as
delivering as one and in accordance with the country's Poverty Reduction
Strategy Papers (PRSPs) and/or strategic plans. The key objective is to have
more change agents and champions that have the capacity and knowledge to
promote and implement land policies, tools and approaches that are pro-poor,
gender-sensitive, effective and sustainable to improve tenure security of the urban and rural poor. 



In this context, there is an urgent need and
increasing demand for GLTN to: continue its work; expand its brand and help
develop capacities of its partners (internal and external); and support the adoption
and implementation of pro-poor and gender appropriate land policies, tools and
approaches at national and local government levels through forging strategic
partnerships and piloting and working at country level. Local government throughout this document also refers to rural
districts and villages as well as urban and rural municipalities.



Purpose of
TSLI-ESA Project 







The main purpose of the TSLI-ESA project has been to
identify common issues and to enhance lesson sharing and knowledge management
on land-related tools and approaches amongst the various projects, country
stakeholders and partners. During
Phase 2 implementation, the project
will further strengthen its linkages with the existing global and regional initiatives such as the African Land Policy Initiative, the FAO-led implementation
of the Voluntary Guidelines (VGs), the
World Bank-led Land Governance
Assessment Framework (LGAF) and
other relevant initiatives or programmes
in the region.



Phase 2 of the TSLI-ESA project will build on the
experiences of the pilot phase and consolidate the capacity-building networks
and lesson-sharing mechanisms that are being formed. It will extend these
activities to include testing the implementation of certain tools in particular
projects, with a view to developing and improving the tools and making their
relevance and application more broadly known. It will continue to focus on East
and Southern Africa while strengthening linkages and collaboration with other
regions especially in Africa and with other global and regional initiatives.

experience in land policy formulation, donor coordination and engagement with
non-state actors has been used as a model for other country's interventions by
UN-Habitat (e.g. DRC, Eastern Caribbean Island
States, South Sudan and Liberia). GLTN
partners from the academia and training institutions are now adopting the land
tools developed, concepts and training packages in their training and
educational curriculum. For example, ITC-Netherlands is now teaching the
concept and use of the Social Tenure Domain Model (STDM) – a pro-poor land
rights recording system to their Masters' Program while the Technical
University of Munich has been mobilizing resources to adopt some GLTN training
packages for their curriculum as well as for conducting the same training
sessions. GLTN's partnership with grassroots organizations has also yielded
some significant successes. Aside from understanding the underlying reasons why
good grassroots land projects have difficulties in going to scale, specific
experiences like that of Brazil resulted in the regularization of an estimated
55,000 slum dwellers.



While significant results have been achieved by GLTN Phase 1, a great
deal more work is required for gains made to be consolidated and extended. GLTN
Phase 2 will further expand its partnership and scope from its known
international partners to UN-Habitat staff and selected land programmes/projects.
It will also implement some of its priority land tools in targeted countries
and/or cities/municipalities in partnership with UN-Habitat's field projects
and/or international partners with their national and local networks,
particularly in regard to the agencies new priority areas of urban land,
legislations and governance. GLTN Phase 2, in close collaboration with UN-Habitat's
regional offices and field operations, and other partners will ensure that
in-country interventions will be within the framework of ‘One UN System' as
delivering as one and in accordance with the country's Poverty Reduction
Strategy Papers (PRSPs) and/or strategic plans. The key objective is to have
more change agents and champions that have the capacity and knowledge to
promote and implement land policies, tools and approaches that are pro-poor,
gender-sensitive, effective and sustainable to improve tenure security of the urban and rural poor. 



In this context, there is an urgent need and
increasing demand for GLTN to: continue its work; expand its brand and help
develop capacities of its partners (internal and external); and support the adoption
and implementation of pro-poor and gender appropriate land policies, tools and
approaches at national and local government levels through forging strategic
partnerships and piloting and working at country level. Local government throughout this document also refers to rural
districts and villages as well as urban and rural municipalities.



Purpose of
TSLI-ESA Project 







The main purpose of the TSLI-ESA project has been to
identify common issues and to enhance lesson sharing and knowledge management
on land-related tools and approaches amongst the various projects, country
stakeholders and partners. During
Phase 2 implementation, the project
will further strengthen its linkages with the existing global and regional initiatives such as the African Land Policy Initiative, the FAO-led implementation
of the Voluntary Guidelines (VGs), the
World Bank-led Land Governance
Assessment Framework (LGAF) and
other relevant initiatives or programmes
in the region.



Phase 2 of the TSLI-ESA project will build on the
experiences of the pilot phase and consolidate the capacity-building networks
and lesson-sharing mechanisms that are being formed. It will extend these
activities to include testing the implementation of certain tools in particular
projects, with a view to developing and improving the tools and making their
relevance and application more broadly known. It will continue to focus on East
and Southern Africa while strengthening linkages and collaboration with other
regions especially in Africa and with other global and regional initiatives.

This proposal's main objective is to
collaborate with UNHCR in supporting the shelter sector by identifying and
assessing shelter needs in order to categorize and map different shelter
response options for support by humanitarian agencies and national partners. The
proposal aims to establish collaboration with UNHCR in the following areas
which will consist of phase I and phase
II:

a) Analysis of shelter
needs outside collective centres and
prioritize actions and recommendations

b) Provide technical
advise and input for strategic shelter policy in form of technical guidance
notes on construction and building materials, emerging shelter needs and trends
and priorities for support and drawing in settlements and property related
advise from UN-Habitat (services, planning, property in neighborhoods areas
affected by crisis)

c) Jointly implement a
shelter response programme in areas of origin or for host families through
innovative solutions by providing technical assistance, training and
information outreach components in municipalities and affected communities

d) Strengthen shelter
sector by establishing needs assessment and shelter options technical working
groups.

The shelter sector working group in Syria
will be strengthened by the needs assessment exercise and technical support for
strategic formulation and information management.

In addition, in the medium to long term, the
shelter options mapping will serve as a tool for better shelter response
planning using common and reliable data and information for needs assessment.

This in turn will allow the people of Liberia to be aware of and exercise their rights to land, to improve their security of tenure, and thus use their land more effectively, promoting peace, stability and economic growth. Strengthening the Land Commission's capacity will be effectuated through core support and embedded technical assistance to the Land Commission, and targeted initiatives in selected areas (2 municipalities and 1 county).
Despite its achievements to date – and in light of the new challenges it will face as the new Agency is established – the Land Commission still has a number of key outputs which it is mandated to complete. In this regard the Land Commission has identified three specific areas which are vital to the achievement of these remaining outputs over the remaining life of the Commission: continuation of core support to the Land Commission through support provided to the Technical Secretariat, which will also allow for a transition into the envisaged new Agency, continuation of support for urban land use and management, and support of the national tribal certificates inventory project. 

Due to the limitations of the Liberian Government budget, there is no Government support for the technical staff of the Commission to undertake all of this important work. The Commissioners cannot implement the ambitious work programme alone. It is only through the continuation of the core funding and technical assistance for the programme staff, currently supported by SIDA through UN-Habitat, that the Commission can employ and retain high-performing staff. The strong capacity of the Commission has been recognized by other donors, who also recognize that if SIDA had not made the core support and technical assistance for the staff possible, they would not have had a capable partner who could efficaciously absorb their funds and undertake productive donor-funded activities. SIDA's core support and UN-Habitat's technical assistance for the Commission's technical staff has also therefore been both critical and catalytic. 

It is all the more so at this crucial moment in the life of the Commission, with just over a year left on its mandate and a delicate and complicated transition to a new Agency ahead. Without core support and technical assistance right now, the entire land reform process would be in jeopardy, and all the considerable gains achieved could be erased. Conversely, with strong support now, the Commission can fulfil the remaining key parts of its mandate and at the same time engender a smooth transition to the new Agency, hopefully retaining considerable capacity and institutional memory.

The overall objective of JPGL II is to promote
improvements in local governance quality that can contribute to peace
consolidation, development and equitable service delivery. For JPLG's overall
objective to be realised, a number of agents
will have to
promote change that
can alter the
status quo in
a direction that
fosters a stronger, more
responsive and accountable
compact between the
state and its
citizens in the
provision of service delivery.
Despite progress the
current context is
still characterised by
limited trust in
government structures at both central and local levels, which in turn
means that their legitimacy is often contested.
This can increase the
risk of a
return to instability
and conflict. Moreover, the political space is still limited especially in southern areas, where
radical groups restrict the voice of many, including women. There is thus
a need
to consolidate and
enlarge the space
for non-state actors
in the rest
of Somalia and
to restore a healthy and accountable state citizen
nexus. 



To achieve the overall objective of JPLG II, the
programme outcomes are structured around three mutually reinforcing
strategies: 



1. Supporting policy and legislative reforms for
functional, fiscal and administrative decentralization that clarify and enhance
the role of local government, its relationship to central government, and as a
means to improve local service delivery.



Outcome 1 will focus on policy
and legal frameworks across Somalia
and is initially designed to address weaknesses in current laws on
decentralization in Somaliland and
Puntland. These provide an incomplete
account of the responsibilities and functions to be devolved to local
government, ignore the fiscal implications and lack supporting regulations for
implementation. These issues need to be
clarified in order to resolve disputes between central line agencies and
districts, and to provide a stronger foundation for local governments to move forward; 



2. Improving local government capacity for
equitable service delivery.



Outcome 2 aims to address the
weak capacity of most local authorities in Somalia by providing a
comprehensive package of training and technical support covering basic elements
of local administration. It also seeks
to improve coordination between
districts and the
centre in planning
and programming to ensure
better consistency and use
of resources. A third output is concerned with increasing
locally generated revenues and strengthening the role and coverage of the LDF;
and, 



1.
Improving
and expanding the delivery of sustainable services to citizens in an equitable,
responsive and socially accountable manner and promoting local economic
environment.



Outcome 3 focuses on improving
the delivery of local services. This is
to be achieved by collaborating more closely with central line
departments, engaging more
directly with non-state
providers, and enhancing
the accountability of local governments to their constituents. Another
element relates to strengthening the local economy, promoting private
investment and enterprise, and creating more and better job opportunities. 



In all of these efforts, JPLG II recognizes the
paramount importance of respecting and promoting local ownership, commitment
and leadership. Without these ingredients,
the prospects of sustaining gains are substantially diminished. For this purpose, JPLG II will continue seek

Addressing these housing problemsrequires a
shift in thinking and practice by governments and housing practitioners. Such
capacity will be enhanced by localising and promoting the Global Housing
Strategy (GHS) that was approved by UN-Habitat Member States in 2011, through
GC Res. 23/16. The GHS encourages the
formation and participatory management of multilateral partnerships at the
national and local level to ensure a “level playing field” of negotiations,
through the creation of National Habitat Committees; the enrichment of the
global strategy by localised, contextualised successful projects, programmes
and strategies and; more importantly, the promotion of inclusive, gender based,
rights based equity measures for the urban poor. The GHS therefore assumes a
double tracked approach: it is neither top-down nor bottom-up, but rather tries
to instigate horizontal governance at all levels of intervention.



The GHS builds on the Global Strategy for
Shelter to the Year 2000 (GSS2000), which was approved by 158 Member States
between 1988 and 2000 and implemented by UN-Habitat in collaboration with
Habitat Agenda partners. Several lessons
have been drawn from this former global initiative, notably that the
commodification of housing and the prevalence of market-dominated housing
production have negatively impacted the availability of affordable housing
supply. Additionally, generalized urban sprawl, the promotion of home ownership
over other tenure modalities coupled with the failure of housing markets to
adequately respond to a variety of demands have contributed to increasing
economic inequality and a divide between developed and under developed urban
areas. The GHS seeks to readdress issues encountered in
the implementation of the GSS2000 at global and country levels, mainly in the
critical developing regions aforementioned, where inequalities and urban
poverty are more manifest and have had a greater impact on access to adequate
and affordable housing. 



This project will enable the practical roll-out
of the Strategy and the development of related capacity in six Least Developed
Countries. The project will draw on global processes to formulate housing and
slum upgrading strategies that integrate the above concerns, implementing
UN-Habitat's Global Housing Strategy at country-level. Six countries will be
selected across the three regions of Africa, Asia-Pacific and Latin America and
the Caribbean, as per the criteria outlined in section 2.2 below.



The Project will also adopt a
regional approach of capacity building. The GHS approach is expected to result
in an increased commitment of additional countries towards the right to adequate
housing, and the principles of inclusive, rights-based and gender-based policy
development. Enhanced South-South cooperation will be sought to support
capacity development in each country, and the replication and scaling up of the
initiative in additional countries of each region. At the global level, it is
expected that this approach will result not only in the (re)positioning of
housing within the global contemporary debate on economically viable,
environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive cities but also on critical
outputs such as: shift in thinking and practice; systemic reforms promoted;
strengthened linkages of housing with other parts of the economy; and
decentralization of housing production and delivery systems.

The
Disaster Management Training Program envisages a strategy on capacity
development through the Disaster Management Training Centre (DMTC) while
leading to safer and resilient communities in the country.Over the
years, recognizing the need for a national center of expertise and training,
added to the Government's vision of linking risk reduction in
development, the Myanmar Action Plan for DRR 2009-2015 (MAPDRR) identifies DMTC as a priority to provide
technical support to Ministries, Departments and other institutions at State/Region
and lower administrative levels and collaborate with ASEAN and other
institutions for research and development. The Government has sanctioned
establishment of DMTC in Ayeyarwaddy Region, in 2012, following a three-year
plan. It would require substantial support in drawing a vision to establish and
implement the objectives of DMTC, as DRR is an emerging area of expertise in
the country.The
DRR WG was formed in 2008, during the early recovery phase of cyclone Nargis,
and has grown into a diverse network of 54 agencies (UN, INGOs and LNGOs), in
Myanmar. In 2013, the DMTC–Technical Working Group (DMTC-TWG) of DRR WG,
comprised of UNDP, UN-Habitat, SEEDS Asia, JICA and APDC, supported the
Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement in organizing an expert
level ‘Consultation Workshop on Developing Capacity Building Strategy through
the Establishment of DMTC in Myanmar'. Subsequently, the DMTC-TWG has been
supporting Relief and Resettlement Department in establishment of the DMTC as
part of DRR WG strategy. In response to the USAID-APS-OFDA-14-000004-Objective 1,
DMTC-TWG members, in discussion with DRR WG, formed a consortium by selecting
agencies through an inclusive and value based criteria. Subsequently, a
consortium led by UN-Habitat with ACTED, ADPC, American Red Cross (with Myanmar
Red Cross Society), SEEDS Asia, UNDP; Technical Partners- UNICEF, IOM, Handicap
International and HelpAge International and Local Partner- ASDA, has been
established. The core competencies of consortium, technical and local partners
would be collectively used to ensure a sustainable and inclusive program.














Consortium
members would bring in-kind contribution (possible staff/technical expertise)
and cost sharing would be explored. It would explore additional sources of
funding, especially for exchange programs and international trainings. An
inclusive approach would engage various departments of Government; Relief and
Resettlement, Social Welfare, Hydrology and Meteorology, General
Administration, Public Information, Education, among others. Linkages would be
established with professional bodies such as Myanmar Engineering Society,
Medical Association, Architects and other informal groups like Youth, Women's
and Religious Groups.














It
is envisaged that through the auspices of the program, a strategic relationship
with the Government would lead to development of long term vision,
identification of needs for DMTC pertinent human resources, curriculum
development, institutional linkages, that would sustain and develop a national
center of excellence.
















The capacity
development activities would strengthen stakeholder leadership and disaster management
knowledge at all levels. Since disaggregated population groups, are affected
differently by disasters, gender, age and impairment sensitive needs will be
inclusively accounted for. Dissemination,
through various channels, of the research findings will be part of the
communication strategy.

The opportunities cities offer for human and economic
development can be tapped when appropriate planning initiatives are undertaken
to manage urban growth for the benefits of all residents. The project will therefore:



(a) Spearhead the development of a Global
framework (the International Guidelines on Urban and Territorial Planning) for
improving policies, plans and designs for more compact, socially inclusive,
better integrated and connected cities and territories that foster sustainable
urban development and are resilient to climate change. These aim at (i)
developing a universally applicable reference framework for national urban
policy reforms; (ii) capturing universal principles from national experiences
that could support the development of a diversity of planning approaches
adapted to different contexts and scales; (iii) complementing and linking other
international guidelines aiming at fostering sustainable urban development;
(iv) raising the urban and territorial dimensions in the development agendas of
national, provincial and local governments.



(b) Promote
the development and implementation of a new generation of national urban
policies (including regional and metropolitan planning strategies) for
sustainable urban development. The development of a national urban policy is
the key step for reasserting urban space and territoriality and for providing
the needed direction and course of action to support urban development. The
national urban policy provides an overarching coordinating framework to address
the most pressing issues related to rapid urban development, including slum
prevention and regularization, access to land, basic services and infrastructure,
urban legislation, delegation of authority to subnational and local
governments, financial flows, urban planning regulations, urban mobility and
urban energy requirements, as well as job creation. 



Approved at
the highest level, a national urban policy should provide the general framework
to orient public interventions in urban areas and be a reference for sectoral
ministries and service providers. It should also be the key reference for
legislative institutional reform. The National Urban Planning Policy is also a
good instrument for public and political awareness of the gains to be obtained
from sustainable urban development, as well as an opportunity to promote
consultation with urban stakeholders. 



Successful
national urban policies generally yield the following results: (a) the
identification of urban development priorities towards socially and
economically equitable and environmentally friendly urban and national
development; (b) guidance on the future development of the national urban system
and its spatial configuration concretized through National and Regional Spatial
Plans for Territorial Development; (c) better coordination and guidance of
actions by national actors, as well as lower levels of government in all
sectors; (d) increased and more coordinated private and public investments in
urban development and consequent improvement of cities productivity,
inclusiveness and environmental conditions. 



(c) Build
and harness capacity at metropolitan, regional, national and global levels, supported
by dedicated strategies and programmes, including human resources development,
tool development, organizational development and institutional strengthening to
achieve sustainable development. An ultimate form of impact at the normative
level will be achieved through supporting countries in developing their
national urban policies, as many countries lack these. UN-Habitat will engage
to influence through these processes, however, it is aware that, due to
government policy processes, achieving results at this level may take a longer.

The purpose of the project is to
     consolidate multi-hazard DRR Architectural and Urban Risk Reduction
     practices in Madagascar, Malawi and Mozambique for Communities and Cities
     to learn how to live with the hazards, in order to address the following
     problems:



-
Problem 1. Community
Infrastructure remains highly vulnerable and emergency preparedness is uneven Communities and their assets (Schools, Housing, Basic
Infrastructure) remain vulnerable to Cyclones, Floods, Droughts and
potentially Earthquakes



Response to Problem 1: Technical Assistance will be provided to consolidate the
know-how acquired in one decade of Architectural/Engineering DRR to Local
Communities; implementing NGOs ; National institutions (i.e. Ministries of
Public Works, Land, Housing and all those in charge of infrastructure as
Education, to build and reconstruct better); the UN/OIs and Red Cross. In
Mozambique TA should be continued to NGOs and UN, to MOPH (Public Works) and
MINED (Education). In Madagascar, depending on the demand from NGOs and
CPGU/BNGRC. In Malawi, DoDMA has requested TA, and large donors are interested
in expanding the approach. In line with the lessons-learnt in DIPECHO III,
laboratories/fields for experiences and training on DRR construction should be
established in Mozambique and Madagascar to train Local Communities and
Constructors, Disaster Management Technicians and Engineers; and students of
Architecture and Engineering. This will serve to disseminate practices with a
long-term impact on how to build more resistant infrastructures and plan safer
settlements. This was requested by Local Authorities, Communities and Ministry
in Madagascar and the Faculty of Architecture and Physical Planning of Mondlane
University in Mozambique and the MOPH. It is in line with both National DRR/DRM
strategies of the intervention countries and sectoral policies (Education,
Infrastructure) and is key to replicate over the long-term the improved
construction measures. This can be also done in cooperation with the DIMSUR,
the Technical Centre funded by GFDRR and initiated by DIPECHO II, as a
long-term strategy for DRR. TA will include the coordination of the Shelter
Cluster (UN-Habitat Mozambique with Red Cross) and Camp Management in Malawi if
relevant (UN-Habitat) to mainstream the practices of improved construction,
adequate emergency shelter, and building back 



-
Problem 2. A strategic approach
is lacking to engage Institutions in adopting DRR policies for built
environment



Response to Problem 2: On the one hand, existing norms and improved construction
measures must be disseminated through on-the-job training of technicians,
constructors and members of communities, for a durable and large impact. This
must be done with both DRR/DRM platforms (INGC, BNGRC, DoDMA) and Sectors
(Ministry of Public Works and Housing and Ministry of Education). This should
consolidate the work done in Madagascar and Mozambique to assess and improve
Building Codes, Building Urban Regulations and Norms as requested by the
Ministry of Public Works and Housing in Mozambique and Malawi. On the other
hand, where non-existing, National and Local Authorities must be supported to
and approve DRR construction practices, to be introduced over the long-term in
the Public and Private construction sector, i.e. National Policies. In
particular, in Malawi the Minister of Land and Housing, in charge of
Infrastructure, requested UNHabitat to assist in the assessment of School
Safety, replicating the experience of UN-Habitat DIPECHO III and GFDRR in
Mozambique. In Mozambique the work delivered by UN-Habitat and National
Partners until now, will require fine-tuning. In fact, as proven through
DIPECHO III and the DIMSUR (Technical Centre for Urban Resilience and Disaster
Risk), Governments have been sensitized to the need to take into account local
practices into policy action, but still need support to transform
best-practices into policies.



-
Problem 3. Cities lack basic capacities for DRR/M,
whereas risks are increasing



Response to Problem 3. Preparedness, prevention and response capacities of
disaster-prone Cities must be enhanced through multisectorial activities
(Governance, Physical Planning, Basic Services, Finance among others). All
cities targeted should increase their awareness of risks related to spatial,
physical, infrastructure issues and adopt vulnerability maps and plans. In
selected cities (at least 2) a full-fledged action-plan for Urban Risk
Reduction, including preparedness and contingency planning, should be
developed. This must be achieved through on-the-job trainings using the
methodology developed in DIPECHO III and the new Tool being prepared by
UN-Habitat. City-to-city trainings and exchange should be also promoted, for
Cities with more experience to share practices with the others. Importantly,
trainings should also target 1) National Disaster Management Institutes, 2)
National Ministries, 3) technical and humanitarian partners on how to act in
Urban Settings for Preventing, Preparing and Responding to Natural Disasters as,
often, there is limited understanding of the role and functioning of the
Municipality or Town Administration. DoDMA has requested the support of
UN-Habitat to fill this gap, and so has CPGU and BNGRC in Madagascar. In
Mozambique, UN-Habitat will continue supporting the MOPH, MICOA and MINED to
include DRR into urban settings, along with the Municipalities

Due
to the absence of City Development Strategies to guide long-range growth,
cities in the state have been unable to cope with the consequences of rapid
urban growth, leading to their failure to contribute to the overall economic
and social development of the state. This has resulted in slum formation,
inadequate housing, and poor provision of basic urban services like water,
sanitation, health, education and climate change.

The
project is designed to strengthen the capacity of Kogi state and the Local
Planning Authorities responsible for the four participating cities to enable them
adopt City Development Strategies that will significantly contribute to dealing
with the various challenges of rapid urbanization in the state. These desired outcome include; adoption of
long-range plans to guide city growth for the next 25 years; promotion of
sustainable development; promotion of gender in development; provision of basic
services including access to water, health, education, communal activities; as
well as of environmental sustainability and efficient transport network, to
enable these cities contribute to national economic growth, poverty reduction
and environmental sustainability.

This
project will build on the experience of past structure planning programmes,
climate change and specifically focus on providing participating cities and
towns with capacities to harness their local assets and resources and expand
economic opportunities, especially for the youth and women.

The
problem highlighted would be addressed with the following:

(a) City Structure Plan for four selected
cities that draws on and strengthens the state's on-going successful urban
renewal progarmme. 

(b) Urban Legislation and Urban Laws
Programme, a collection of policies, laws, and practices that govern the
management and development of the urban environment and citizens' behavior.



(c) Establish Kogi State Urban Observatory (a
unique monitoring system developed by UN-HABITAT) that builds indicator systems
through data collection, analysis, monitoring and reporting on sustainable
urbanization.



(d) Developing an Integrated Solid Waste
Management Plan, a holistic, strategic and systematic approach to solid waste
management based on the Waste Management Hierarchy Model: Avoid, Reduce, Reuse,
Recycle, Recover and Dispose. 



(e) Developing an Early Warning System for
Climate-related extreme events such as floods and droughts. A prototype (in the
form of a guidance tool) that provides guidance on managing extreme events from
the back end (data collection sources) to the front end (delivery of warnings
to vulnerable people).

NSP promotes a development paradigm whereby communities are empowered to make decisions and manage resources during all stages of the project cycle. The programme lays the foundation for a sustainable form of inclusive local governance, rural reconstruction, and poverty alleviation. NSP is the largest community development programme in the history of Afghanistan. Known in Dari as “Hambastagi Milli” and in Pashtu as “Milli Paiwastoon”, it is based on the Afghan traditions of “Ashar” (i.e. community members working together on a volunteer basis to improve community infrastructure) and “Jirga” – councils comprised of respected members of the community. Islamic values of unity, equity and justice are also encouraged.

NSP promotes a development paradigm whereby communities are empowered to make decisions and manage resources during all stages of the project cycle. The programme lays the foundation for a sustainable form of inclusive local governance, rural reconstruction, and poverty alleviation. NSP is the largest community development programme in the history of Afghanistan. Known in Dari as “Hambastagi Milli” and in Pashtu as “Milli Paiwastoon”, it is based on the Afghan traditions of “Ashar” (i.e. community members working together on a volunteer basis to improve community infrastructure) and “Jirga” – councils comprised of respected members of the community. Islamic values of unity, equity and justice are also encouraged. The following principles guide “how” the programme is implemented: participatory and inclusive decision-making processes; gender equity; transparency and accountability in the use of programme funds; and sustainability (including but not limited to requiring community contributions for operations and maintenance).

TheProgramme to be supported by the Cities Alliance shall establish cooperationbetween the DGHS and three cities in Indonesia that already practicegood governance and already invest in better urban environments. The cooperation shall encourage the ‘goodpractice’ cities to drive further the development and dissemination ofeffective city investment planning under the ‘RPIJM’ label. The three cities will set down developshowcase pro-poor and participatory citywide development and financing strategies. DGHS will underscore the efforts bychannelling investment funding to the cities on a priority basis. Together,DGHS and the cities will document and disseminate proven and validated goodurban management and investment practices to new cities, making use of theRPIJM facilitator network, the USDRP city network and city-to-city networkingdirectly undertaken by the three cities, in collaboration with a national localgovernment authority.
The specificobjectives of the cooperation are:
(A) Objectives relevant to each of thethree cities:
a) to capture “why urban investmentworks”, i.e. the actual city development strategies established in the threecities, with and through city stakeholders 
b) to produce showcase city developmentand financing strategies and action plans in the respective cities, captured incomprehensive RPIJM strategies and action plans, which fully incorporate theCDS (SPK) process and are validated by all relevant stakeholders
c) to channel national-leveldevelopment funding to the respective cities, based on the RPIJMs, in order totest and further strengthen the CDS and RPIJM strategies.
(B) Objectives relevant to the aim ofnational mainstreaming through DGHS:
d) to absorb the good practices,knowhow and experiences into an improved RPIJM toolkit that fully incorporatesthe CDS (SPK) process
e) to disseminate the expertise,through DGHS, via the provincial RPIJM facilitators engaged by DGHS
f) to engage other central governmentagencies in order to validate CDS (SPK) and RPIJM as a general tool for fundingallocation in and to cities
(C) Objectives relevant to the aim ofcity-to-city learning:
g) to engage the USDRP cities, on apriority basis, in city-to-city learning initiatives with the three cities, inorder to disseminate the CDS experiences in the three cities but also todisseminate learning from the investment pilots undertaken in USDRP cities 
h) to promote city-to-city learning,with the three cities in the lead, to a wider audience of city governments andstakeholders in Indonesia,with the assistance of a national local government authority (to be selected).

Providing adequate shelter since it is a priority concern for almost half of IDP families (48%). The majority live in rented accommodation and are burdened with high rent prices. A significant population shelter with host families (8.8%), or live in tents or makeshift shelters on the host families' land (1.8 %). In addition, a large percentage of displaced families that cannot afford to rent, live in informal settlements (9.5%), often in structures made from mud, sticks and other salvaged materials, or have occupied public buildings and former military camps (2.6%). These families are threatened with forceful eviction with no alternative accommodation available.[1] 

The target group benefitting from the project are IDPs and other vulnerable living within unplanned settlements in Baghdad. The project will directly benefit approximately 900 vulnerable families, predominantly IDPs that will access secure land tenure and improved living environment through government financed settlement upgrading. IDPs will benefit from technical assistance to a resettlement project in Mahmoudiya; and pending commitment from the Governor of Baghdad, IDP families in Bahith El Almi will also benefit from technical assistance related to the proposed land sharing project. It is expected that through relevant professional training of key institutions within the TC, government will be more able to apply their resources to supporting IDPs and other vulnerable families living in unplanned settlements, accordingly it is expected that this project will trigger support to a wider vulnerable group. 

Based on tools developed in Phase I of the project and lessons learnt from pilot projects, this project will support the GoI and selected Baghdad districts to move forward with the implementation of Shelter Strategy that was developed by MoMD in conjunction with UN-Habitat, by up keeping institutional capacity to do so, following district level roadmaps while undertaking community-led upgrading/resettlement projects.

The main possible implementing partners are: NRC, MoP, MoMD, MMPW, MoCH, Amanat Baghdad, Baghdad Governor, UNHCR and members of the UNDAF Housing Priority Working (PWG).

The project is designed to positively influence current practices in the building sector by promoting a systematic and comprehensive approach for stimulating a market demand for energy efficient buildings in the region.
Although increased energy efficiency is highlighted as a key objective in many policy papers in the target countries, none of them has an energy efficiency law/bylaw/regulatory system for buildings and constructions. This project seeks: to mainstream energy efficiency into the existing legislation; and, to build on ongoing initiatives and develop an energy efficiency regulatory system for new and existing buildings. The project will also focus on green architecture, with the emphasis on effective policies, regulations and standards that integrate energy efficiency into building design.
Without the intervention, no major improvement can be expected in the medium term in all the five countries. This project's regional approach will avoid duplication of efforts, will increase efficiency in the use of resources and will create competition among the countries for adopting and implementing of EEB's regulations. The strong awareness, capacity building and technical assistance that will link the government agencies cooperating with international experts will favor knowledge sharing and transfer.
The project “Promoting Energy Efficiency in Buildings in East Africa” will include five inter-related components, namely:

Component 1: Energy Efficiency Data and Benchmarks in the Building Sector. This component will address existing gaps in terms of consistent, relevant and adequate data of various types of buildings (all related to EEB) in the region. It will allow formulating benchmarks, as well as identifying opportunities and energy saving potentials. 
Component 2: Formulation and Adoption of Energy Efficiency Codes in Buildings. This component is the core of Promoting EEB in East Africa and will target the revision of the country specific building code and municipal by laws to include EEB with reference to the specific climatic zones. Moreover, toolkits and guidelines will be developed for the application of the building code, especially in related municipal by laws. Civil servants will be capacitated to administer the implementation of the new regulations. 
Component 3: Awareness Raising and Capacity Building in EE, and Best Practices in the Building Sector. This component rests on three main pillars, the awareness creation with the general public, the technical capacity building for professionals on EEB and the East African Energy Efficiency in Buildings Award, as an instrument to create regional recognition for architects, building owners, real estate developers and other actors that have adopted energy efficiency and green building criteria in their buildings. 
Component 4: Appropriate Financial Framework for the Promotion of EE Measures in Buildings. This component will focus on EEB finance, following an approach that includes top-level advocacy with the top-managements of commercial banks; training and capacity building on EEB finance; and the introduction of the green mortgage concept in the region. Green/EEB investment portfolios will be developed together with the banks. This component will also establish pilot financial mechanisms in all partner countries. 
Component 5: Development and Implementation of Pilot Projects. This project component will provide technical assistance to all ongoing governmental mass housings projects regarding the incorporation of EEB measures. In partner countries where the EEB code has been approved and adopted, the implementation of the code will be tested in reality and on scale. Operational models will be created for the mainstreaming. An advisory team will provide technical assistance in EEB with respect to planning, design and construction. Important concepts to be promoted will include natural lighting, ventilation and cooling systems; adequate building orientation, the use of sun shading devices; solar water heaters, energy saving lamps etc. The team will also advice on retrofitting existing buildings. The direct GHG emission reductions of this program will be achieved here.
It is the projects assumption that the joint implementation of these interlinked components (jointly together with the National Governments and the EAC) in close cooperation with relevant projects by the international donor community will provide sufficient momentum for the achievement of the project objective.

is to strengthen the capacity of local, central, and regional institutions and
key stakeholders in settlement and slum improvement through the use of good
governance and management approaches, pilot projects, and contributing, where
needed, to policy development and the implementation of institutional,
legislative, financial, and normative and implementation frameworks. To meet
these challenges, the PSUP programme seeks to harmonize with local and national
stakeholders on key slum upgrading projects through creating a network for
regional slum upgrading challenges. For this purpose, regional training and
policy seminars on the programme's concept, themes, and methods will be
organized with all stakeholders involved. The programme also aims to support
local and national authorities in identifying adequate funding to carry out
specific activities.

Objective 1: To enable
national, city and community representatives and planning authorities to assess
urban development needs and urban poverty in ACP countries through applying
cross-sector approaches and building ownership for the urban sector challenges
– this includes the acknowledgement of informal settlements as an integral part
of cities, and with the population therein addressed through a rights-based
approach.

Particularly,
municipalities and line ministries responsible for urban development lack human
and financial resources for urban governance and management. Actions in urban
areas lack coordination and often there is duplication of efforts addressing
the same context with very limited resources. Further, apart from strengthening
institutions to address urban poverty in an appropriate way, a link between
financing and technical government bodies is essential to finance urban poverty
in a sustainable way, also beyond this action.

Objective 2: To empower
ACP countries national, city and community representatives as well as planning
authorities to address slum dwellers' needs for better living conditions in
their cities with adequate planning tools and realistic resource mobilization
strategies – addressing and including the slum population directly in designing
slum upgrading programmes.

Often the identification
of slum upgrading needs lack continuation, implementation and the participation
of the target group. The formulation of slum upgrading projects is often
isolated and sector specific. This often leads to single projects improving living
conditions in the short-term or even leading to conflicts and negative impacts
on the ground.

The capacity to develop
slum upgrading programmes in an integrated and participatory manner under the
leadership of the government and in the context of the whole city or town, with
its overall development opportunities, is not taken care off.

In addition, policy and
regulatory frameworks often hinder sustainable and affordable urban
infrastructure, land and housing (from plot sizes, land regulations or secure tenure
and housing building codes to provision of basic services). This programme aims
at overcoming divides of the informal and formal city and improvement at
national and city or town level.

Objective 3: Empower
national, city and community representatives and planning authorities to
implement innovative slum upgrading programmes that demonstrate successful slum
upgrading interventions which are to be up-scaled and replicated in other
towns, cities and neighbourhoods and increase visibility.

Besides during the
implementation of slum upgrading programmes, not all key stakeholders are aware
or involved in the process. This can lead to institutional and community
blockages in cross-sector activities or to the initial target group not fully
benefiting from the action, and if implemented with external experts, the lack
of replication and institutional memory.

The design and
implementation of slum upgrading activities shall be carried by all
stakeholders with their different roles. It shall create job opportunities for
the target group and be enriched through their local knowledge. By having the
cross-sector approach, actions and improvements shall multiply their impact
through feeding into each other. The high visibility and improved capacity
shall lead to an up-scaling and replication of activities finding its
reflection in national priorities, budgets and policies beyond this action.

In order to achieve the
three major operational objectives in an efficient way, UN-Habitat emphasises
the importance of a coherent advocacy strategy. This can be strengthened by an
enforced tripartite partnership between the European Commission and the
European Union Delegations, the ACP Secretariat and UN-Habitat, as well as
government (line ministries and finance and planning ministries) to prioritise
and budget for urban development needs and slum upgrading.

The PSUP is carried out at local, national
and regional levels. Local, national and regional programme focal points are
trained on effective and inclusive stakeholder mapping and mobilisation in
different programme processes. The programme is fully implemented by national
implementation partners and overseen by national stakeholders.

The stakeholders consist of the following:

Local level: local authorities at all levels
(both managerial and political), NGOs, CBOs, planning and training
institutions, research institutions, academia, the private and informal sector,
as well as local slum upgrading initiatives and slum dwellers of identified
neighbourhoods;

National level: relevant ministries,
technical departments, offices providing statistics, local government
associations, national and international NGOs, CBO representatives, private and
informal sector representatives, academia, and national planning, development and
training institutions.

The PSUP approach aims to build country
teams reflecting both local and national interests. Particular attention will
be given to the selection of implementing agencies in order to provide a higher
degree of capacity-building in relevant institutions and to embed the
activities of the programme in the institutional set-up of respective countries.

The overall objectives of this
proposal are to: (i) provide regional ToT and development of
suitable toolkits so as to support the foundations for country up-scaling and
regional replication of CDS, SUS and other proven good urbanization practices
and processes, (ii) manage lessons learned and knowledge acquired so as to
strengthen implementation of the Pacific Urban Agenda (as contained in the
Pacific Plan) national obligations and commitments, (iii) facilitate and
institutionalize urban policy dialogue into regional and national planning so
as to establish consensus with stakeholders on urbanisation priorities,
strengthen partnerships, and up scale resource mobilization to achieve better
urban outcomes, and (iv) strengthen monitoring by the SPC of the urban
commitments made under the Pacific Plan activities (namely, the PUA). The
latter will include an assessment of options to establish a Pacific Regional
Urban Observatory. The proposal will support the requests of the 3 PICs and
others to concurrently develop and implement their CDSs and SUSs by providing
regional (i) institutional strengthening, (ii) knowledge management and (iii)
support to strengthen urban policy and project development. It is hoped such
processes will lead to (iv) improved monitoring of urban performance by PICs
including integration of city and national responses to addressing urban issues
vis a vis the PUA and the Pacific Plan. 

Key outcomes resulting from the above
will be strengthened national capacity to undertake up scaling of under
serviced settlements, an increased number of PICs wanting to undertake CDS and
SUS, more national policy makers, planners and training partners interested in
addressing urbanisation issues, and development of a formal mechanism to
capture, share and disseminate knowledge learned. Commitments under the PUA
should also be pursued and monitored. More effective human capacities and
strengthened national and regional institutional structures should result in
the better management of the impacts of urbanization in a sustainable manner
and the improved performance of urban areas. By monitoring and sharing lessons
and knowledge acquired, the CA Regional Support component will add further
value to the effectiveness of the CDS and SUS processes being undertaken in the
3 selected PICs, including national, city and community levels. 

Under this CA Regional Support proposal, the suite of institutional
capacity building activities that will share global toolkits for national
customization and the possible development towards the end of proposal
implementation of a “Pacific Regional CDS and SUS toolkit” along with the
results emerging from national experiences such as good practice and lessons
learned, which will feed into the development of a Pacific Urban Knowledge
Management framework. This
will emphasize dialogue and dissemination of urban information and knowledge
gained. An agreed and accepted regional
institutional policy dialogue framework will add value to both regional and
national urban monitoring arrangements as well as implementation of national
initiatives such as the CDS and SUS. Regional and national realignment will
demonstrate the importance of urbanisation and the need for timely urban
management responses, including far stronger institutional arrangements such as
the possible development, for example, of a Pacific “Regional Urban
Observatory” as well as regional urban management tools. This would form part
of a network of National and sub-Regional Urban Observatories planned by
UCLG. The benefits of a Pacific Regional
Urban Observatory would be the sharing of information, the provision of
technical assistance (for example, urban data processing support, examples of
data use by community organizations, and methods of data analysis), monitoring
of regional agreed urban tools such as Pacific Urbanisation Development Goals,
the institutionalization of knowledge exchange, the standardization of
indicators and the development of Pacific regional dialogue on indicator use. The scope of this CA Regional Support
proposal also places a strong emphasis on strengthening capacity to document
and analyze knowledge acquired. This includes knowledge creation, sharing and
dissemination to promote and support the preparation and implementation of
local, town, city and national led CDS and SUS, building on lessons learned
from Samoa, Fiji and PNG to other PICs. Given
that a knowledge platform has been established in the Geography Department of
the University of the South pacific (but is no longer being updated), the CLGF
are discussing establishing a Local Government Resource Centre (with website
for urban issues), and UNESCAP has approved funding to support knowledge
management activities under its project “capacity-building of SIDS to
incorporate the Mauritius Strategy into NSD strategies”, this regional support
proposal will review where and how best knowledge management frameworks should
best be anchored and support development of an urban component to give
visibility and disseminate PUA compliance through best practices, initially on
behalf of PIPA as it receives strengthening support under Component 5, with
intended sharing of the urban component to a PIPA website as this develops.
PIPA has planning (and lands, surveying, environmentalist professional)
membership representation from PIC local and central government, and has been
receiving modest resource support from AusAID through the Planning Institute of
Australia (PIA). PIPA provides a network of Pacific planning professionals,
often geographically isolated, where they seek to share and obtain information
on current urban development activities and experiences such as squatters,
customary land mobilization and informal settlements. Members of PIPA are interested in addressing
urban solutions which are seen to be working in pilot projects around the
Pacific, expanding the number of stakeholders involved (especially development
partners), building skills and filling capacity shortages (such as in mediation
and negotiation), and strengthening the planning process to which solutions
such as CDS and SUS must be developed and molded. 

A key outcome of developing an urban
knowledge management framework will be strengthening of country CA project
implementation and monitoring and through such monitoring, collation of the
documentation of the implementation of the 3 country CA proposals. Lessons
learned would be synthesized and through such analysis, UNESCAP will coordinate
development of the Pacific knowledge management framework located in its
Pacific Office (EPO), Suva, Fiji, which has been a major supporter of the PUA
and its implementation within the region. A Knowledge Management officer would
be supported by this proposal, UN-HABITAT and EPO to maintain the collection of
documents, an online portal that is linked to other pertinent websites and
disseminate information to ensure accessibility to this information.

The knowledge management framework
would be focused initially on a website portal with access to documentation, as
well as PIPA coordinated regional workshops for the sharing of lessons,
knowledge acquired and implications. This would assist in the process of
fulfillment of country responsibilities under the PUA and Pacific Plan whilst
providing access to assistance on developing urban work plans, urban
indicators, squatter upgrading, mainstreaming CDS and SUS into NSDPs, access to
toolkits and the like. In this context,
members of PIPA would become the core capacity building arm for practicing
urban planners, managers and decision makers in the Pacific region. PIPA as the
regional focal point would ensure that the CDS and SUS principles and practices
as adapted to the Pacific are disseminated and up scaled nationally to members.
Working with development partners, the knowledge management framework would
assist to underpin sustainable urbanization policy dialogue in the region, such
dialogue feeding back into regional policies and plans such as the Pacific
Plan, as monitored by the SPC. 

This proposal's scope includes assisting SPC to undertake
high level policy dialogue with PICs so as to institutionalize the PUA, CDS and
SUS processes into national urban policy frameworks. A Pacific Ministerial Conference on the ‘State
of Urbanisation in the Pacific' would be one way to achieve this, to be held
towards the end of this Regional Support proposal's implementation, when the
good practices and lessons learned would be synthesized and visible. As SPC is already working with PICs in
developing three yearly Joint Country Strategies (JCS), it has already started
to mainstream the PUA, CDS and SUS concepts into these processes. This proposal
will therefore also support SPC to strengthen the monitoring of PUA
implementation and supporting initiatives. The objective is to enable SPC to
become more effective in its regional reporting and monitoring role of ensuring
commitments under the Pacific Plan (namely, the PUA) are progressed as well as
mainstreaming other urban initiatives. To assist SPC in its monitoring role,
the possible development of a Pacific Regional Urban Observatory including
development of a set of Pacific urbanisation Development Goals will be
explored. This will providing longer term ‘backstopping' support to SPC as it
takes on this new PUA monitoring and assistance role. The latter are vital to ensuring
sustainability of efforts at the regional level, given the role of PIFS as the
lead regional agency.

national urban monitoring arrangements as well as implementation of national
initiatives such as the CDS and SUS. Regional and national realignment will
demonstrate the importance of urbanisation and the need for timely urban
management responses, including far stronger institutional arrangements such as
the possible development, for example, of a Pacific “Regional Urban
Observatory” as well as regional urban management tools. This would form part
of a network of National and sub-Regional Urban Observatories planned by
UCLG. The benefits of a Pacific Regional
Urban Observatory would be the sharing of information, the provision of
technical assistance (for example, urban data processing support, examples of
data use by community organizations, and methods of data analysis), monitoring
of regional agreed urban tools such as Pacific Urbanisation Development Goals,
the institutionalization of knowledge exchange, the standardization of
indicators and the development of Pacific regional dialogue on indicator use. The scope of this CA Regional Support
proposal also places a strong emphasis on strengthening capacity to document
and analyze knowledge acquired. This includes knowledge creation, sharing and
dissemination to promote and support the preparation and implementation of
local, town, city and national led CDS and SUS, building on lessons learned
from Samoa, Fiji and PNG to other PICs. Given
that a knowledge platform has been established in the Geography Department of
the University of the South pacific (but is no longer being updated), the CLGF
are discussing establishing a Local Government Resource Centre (with website
for urban issues), and UNESCAP has approved funding to support knowledge
management activities under its project “capacity-building of SIDS to
incorporate the Mauritius Strategy into NSD strategies”, this regional support
proposal will review where and how best knowledge management frameworks should
best be anchored and support development of an urban component to give
visibility and disseminate PUA compliance through best practices, initially on
behalf of PIPA as it receives strengthening support under Component 5, with
intended sharing of the urban component to a PIPA website as this develops.
PIPA has planning (and lands, surveying, environmentalist professional)
membership representation from PIC local and central government, and has been
receiving modest resource support from AusAID through the Planning Institute of
Australia (PIA). PIPA provides a network of Pacific planning professionals,
often geographically isolated, where they seek to share and obtain information
on current urban development activities and experiences such as squatters,
customary land mobilization and informal settlements. Members of PIPA are interested in addressing
urban solutions which are seen to be working in pilot projects around the
Pacific, expanding the number of stakeholders involved (especially development
partners), building skills and filling capacity shortages (such as in mediation
and negotiation), and strengthening the planning process to which solutions
such as CDS and SUS must be developed and molded. 

A key outcome of developing an urban
knowledge management framework will be strengthening of country CA project
implementation and monitoring and through such monitoring, collation of the
documentation of the implementation of the 3 country CA proposals. Lessons
learned would be synthesized and through such analysis, UNESCAP will coordinate
development of the Pacific knowledge management framework located in its
Pacific Office (EPO), Suva, Fiji, which has been a major supporter of the PUA
and its implementation within the region. A Knowledge Management officer would
be supported by this proposal, UN-HABITAT and EPO to maintain the collection of
documents, an online portal that is linked to other pertinent websites and
disseminate information to ensure accessibility to this information.

The knowledge management framework
would be focused initially on a website portal with access to documentation, as
well as PIPA coordinated regional workshops for the sharing of lessons,
knowledge acquired and implications. This would assist in the process of
fulfillment of country responsibilities under the PUA and Pacific Plan whilst
providing access to assistance on developing urban work plans, urban
indicators, squatter upgrading, mainstreaming CDS and SUS into NSDPs, access to
toolkits and the like. In this context,
members of PIPA would become the core capacity building arm for practicing
urban planners, managers and decision makers in the Pacific region. PIPA as the
regional focal point would ensure that the CDS and SUS principles and practices
as adapted to the Pacific are disseminated and up scaled nationally to members.
Working with development partners, the knowledge management framework would
assist to underpin sustainable urbanization policy dialogue in the region, such
dialogue feeding back into regional policies and plans such as the Pacific
Plan, as monitored by the SPC. 

This proposal's scope includes assisting SPC to undertake
high level policy dialogue with PICs so as to institutionalize the PUA, CDS and
SUS processes into national urban policy frameworks. A Pacific Ministerial Conference on the ‘State
of Urbanisation in the Pacific' would be one way to achieve this, to be held
towards the end of this Regional Support proposal's implementation, when the
good practices and lessons learned would be synthesized and visible. As SPC is already working with PICs in
developing three yearly Joint Country Strategies (JCS), it has already started
to mainstream the PUA, CDS and SUS concepts into these processes. This proposal
will therefore also support SPC to strengthen the monitoring of PUA
implementation and supporting initiatives. The objective is to enable SPC to
become more effective in its regional reporting and monitoring role of ensuring
commitments under the Pacific Plan (namely, the PUA) are progressed as well as
mainstreaming other urban initiatives. To assist SPC in its monitoring role,
the possible development of a Pacific Regional Urban Observatory including
development of a set of Pacific urbanisation Development Goals will be
explored. This will providing longer term ‘backstopping' support to SPC as it
takes on this new PUA monitoring and assistance role. The latter are vital to ensuring
sustainability of efforts at the regional level, given the role of PIFS as the
lead regional agency.

The overall objective of JPGL II is to promote
improvements in local governance quality that can contribute to peace
consolidation, development and equitable service delivery. For JPLG's overall
objective to be realised, a number of agents
will have to
promote change that
can alter the
status quo in
a direction that
fosters a stronger, more
responsive and accountable
compact between the
state and its
citizens in the
provision of service delivery.
Despite progress the
current context is
still characterised by
limited trust in
government structures at both central and local levels, which in turn
means that their legitimacy is often contested.
This can increase the
risk of a
return to instability
and conflict. Moreover, the political space is still limited especially in southern areas, where
radical groups restrict the voice of many, including women. There is thus
a need
to consolidate and
enlarge the space
for non-state actors
in the rest
of Somalia and
to restore a healthy and accountable state citizen
nexus. 



To achieve the overall objective of JPLG II, the
programme outcomes are structured around three mutually reinforcing
strategies: 



1. Supporting policy and legislative reforms for
functional, fiscal and administrative decentralization that clarify and enhance
the role of local government, its relationship to central government, and as a
means to improve local service delivery.



Outcome 1 will focus on policy
and legal frameworks across Somalia
and is initially designed to address weaknesses in current laws on
decentralization in Somaliland and
Puntland. These provide an incomplete
account of the responsibilities and functions to be devolved to local
government, ignore the fiscal implications and lack supporting regulations for
implementation. These issues need to be
clarified in order to resolve disputes between central line agencies and
districts, and to provide a stronger foundation for local governments to move forward; 



2. Improving local government capacity for
equitable service delivery.



Outcome 2 aims to address the
weak capacity of most local authorities in Somalia by providing a
comprehensive package of training and technical support covering basic elements
of local administration. It also seeks
to improve coordination between
districts and the
centre in planning
and programming to ensure
better consistency and use
of resources. A third output is concerned with increasing
locally generated revenues and strengthening the role and coverage of the LDF;
and, 



1.
Improving
and expanding the delivery of sustainable services to citizens in an equitable,
responsive and socially accountable manner and promoting local economic
environment.



Outcome 3 focuses on improving
the delivery of local services. This is
to be achieved by collaborating more closely with central line
departments, engaging more
directly with non-state
providers, and enhancing
the accountability of local governments to their constituents. Another
element relates to strengthening the local economy, promoting private
investment and enterprise, and creating more and better job opportunities. 



In all of these efforts, JPLG II recognizes the
paramount importance of respecting and promoting local ownership, commitment
and leadership. Without these ingredients,
the prospects of sustaining gains are substantially diminished. For this purpose, JPLG II will continue seek
support and political commitment at the highest
levels of Government,

Cities are expected to work simultaneously in the five dimensions of prosperity: productivity, infrastructure, quality of life, equity and environmental sustainability. 
The City Prosperity Initiative is a practical framework for the formulation, implementation, and monitoring of sustainability policies and practices to increase prosperity levels at city level. It is an initiative that provides collaborative solutions to the most fundamental challenges facing cities.
Specifically, it is an Initiative of 250 cities globally that are committed to a more holistic, people-centred and sustainable notion of prosperity and pledge to deploy necessary efforts and resources to move forward in the prosperity path will be created. The aim is to enable a shift away from prevailing narrow and lopsided conceptualizations of prosperity and related policies and actions. The rationale for this is that without a new and revised conceptualization of prosperity at strategic policy levels, cities risk promoting strategies that threaten rather than enhance sustainability.
By estimating the City Prosperity Index (CPI) of cities based on globally comparable data, UN-Habitat will create an invaluable baseline for tracking progress in terms of prosperity. In addition, in conducting estimations in cities through the Initiative, UN-Habitat will also adapt the CPI to correspond to locally available data, policy priorities and needs. Thus, the Initiative will enable globally comparable yet locally specific estimation and monitoring of urban prosperity.
Three intermediate accomplishments of the Cities Prosperity Initiative will be:

Improved policies and strategies of cities towards prosperity path are catalyzed through customised action plans. 
Cities begin to implement actions and policies to advance on a prosperity path based on a customised action plan. 
Cities have enhanced capacity to measure and monitor present and future progress towards the prosperity path.
At a more local level, the Cities Prosperity Initiative aims at:

Reinforcing local capacities to increase economies of scale and agglomeration for improved wellbeing and prosperity through localized urban planning and design interventions. 
Assisting in implementing a variety of technical solutions for improving the functionality of the city and achieving sustainable urban form. 
Assisting in packaging projects through pre-feasibility studies and project viability for financing.
The benefits of engagement arising from the Technical Advisory Package offered by UN-Habitat through the Initiative are captured in the table below.

Lessons Learned

Following from the above, the expected outputs of the project are as follows:
1.Cities create conditions to embark on actions and policies to advance in a path of prosperity
2.Cities begin to implement actions and policies to advance in a path of prosperity based on a tailored General Action Plan and related Road Map
3.Cities are capable to monitor, measure and evaluate progress towards the prosperity path
The City Prosperity Index, together with a conceptual matrix, the Wheel of Prosperity, both of which are meant to facilitate designing of clear policy interventions, will form the basis of the technical advisory package described above. This is accompanied by additional technical support in a wide spectrum of areas such as institutional analysis, strategic thinking, guidelines, training and capacity development, monitoring tools, urban futures analysis, and policy simulations all designed to help cities to advance on the prosperity path in a more sustainable manner. 

UN-Habitat's wheel of prosperity symbolizes the well-balanced development of the five dimensions, the current condition of which is graphically represented in the City Prosperity Index. The outer rim absorbs the cumulative forces transmitted through the spokes the five dimensions of prosperity. At the centre is the hub the local urban power functions, with four interrelated roles: ensuring the prevalence of public over any other kind of interest; controlling the direction, pace and momentum of the wheel; ensuring the balanced development of the five spokes and associated synergies; and in a two-way relationship, absorbing and amortizing any shocks transmitted by the spokes.
The hub brings together the power functions (e.g., laws, regulations and institutions, urban planning, civil society, trade associations, special agencies, etc.) associated with the five spokes. In this role the hub represents human agency in all its embodiments. Clearly therefore, the thematic focus of the project is directly linked to and integrates all of UN-Habitat's thematic priorities as symbolized by its 7 Branches. The operationalization of the Cities Prosperity Initiative will involve all Branches of UN-Habitat given the direct linkages between the five dimensions of the Wheel of Urban Prosperity (productivity, urban infrastructure, quality of life, equity and environmental sustainability) and ongoing work in UN-Habitat's thematic Branches. Once the CPI is estimated for cities, UN-Habitat's Branches will be fully engaged in the roll out of the Technical Advisory Package (see above) especially in the diagnosis of prosperity challenges and opportunities to prepare a general action plan and road map; identification of appropriate innovative solutions, best practices, tools and guides to facilitate operationalization of the general action plan and road map; and technical advisory services to support the establishment of local monitoring mechanisms to track progress on a path of prosperity. 
In addition, UN-Habitat's regional offices and Habitat Programme Managers will play a critical role in the operationalization of the Cities Prosperity Initiative and related activities. Accordingly, using seed funding obtained from the UN-Habitat Internal Development Fund, the recruitment of three consultants to be located in UN-Habitat offices in Africa, Asia and Latin America is already underway.
A number of external partners will also play a critical role in the realization of the objectives of the City Prosperity Initiative. These include local and metropolitan authorities, urban development authorities, local and regional academic, policy and research institutes, national and regional banks and Habitat Professionals Associations. Furthermore, where available, UN-Habitat will rely on Local Urban Observatories (LOUs) for gathering and processing data for the estimation of CPIs. Moreover, LUOs will be used as a platform for establishing specific prosperity monitoring mechanism for in each city.",2,2013-04-01,2015-12-31,,,,,,,ZAPOPAN,,,,,,,,,,,,MX,Mexico,100,489,"South America, regional",,43082,Research/scientific institutions,,OECD Development Assistance Committee,DAC,1,110,20,CO1,CO1

The operationalization of the Cities Prosperity Initiative will involve all Branches of UN-Habitat given the direct linkages between the five dimensions of the Wheel of Urban Prosperity (productivity, urban infrastructure, quality of life, equity and environmental sustainability) and ongoing work in UN-Habitat's thematic Branches. Once the CPI is estimated for cities, UN-Habitat's Branches will be fully engaged in the roll out of the Technical Advisory Package (see above) especially in the diagnosis of prosperity challenges and opportunities to prepare a general action plan and road map; identification of appropriate innovative solutions, best practices, tools and guides to facilitate operationalization of the general action plan and road map; and technical advisory services to support the establishment of local monitoring mechanisms to track progress on a path of prosperity. 
In addition, UN-Habitat's regional offices and Habitat Programme Managers will play a critical role in the operationalization of the Cities Prosperity Initiative and related activities. Accordingly, using seed funding obtained from the UN-Habitat Internal Development Fund, the recruitment of three consultants to be located in UN-Habitat offices in Africa, Asia and Latin America is already underway.
A number of external partners will also play a critical role in the realization of the objectives of the City Prosperity Initiative. These include local and metropolitan authorities, urban development authorities, local and regional academic, policy and research institutes, national and regional banks and Habitat Professionals Associations. Furthermore, where available, UN-Habitat will rely on Local Urban Observatories (LOUs) for gathering and processing data for the estimation of CPIs. Moreover, LUOs will be used as a platform for establishing specific prosperity monitoring mechanism for in each city.",2,2013-04-01,2015-12-31,,,,,,,ZAPOPAN,,,,,,,,,,,,MX,Mexico,100,489,"South America, regional",,43082,Research/scientific institutions,,OECD Development Assistance Committee,DAC,1,110,20,CO1,CO1

The overall objective of JPGL II is to promote
improvements in local governance quality that can contribute to peace
consolidation, development and equitable service delivery. For JPLG's overall
objective to be realised, a number of agents
will have to
promote change that
can alter the
status quo in
a direction that
fosters a stronger, more
responsive and accountable
compact between the
state and its
citizens in the
provision of service delivery.
Despite progress the
current context is
still characterised by
limited trust in
government structures at both central and local levels, which in turn
means that their legitimacy is often contested.
This can increase the
risk of a
return to instability
and conflict. Moreover, the political space is still limited especially in southern areas, where
radical groups restrict the voice of many, including women. There is thus
a need
to consolidate and
enlarge the space
for non-state actors
in the rest
of Somalia and
to restore a healthy and accountable state citizen
nexus. 



To achieve the overall objective of JPLG II, the
programme outcomes are structured around three mutually reinforcing
strategies: 



1. Supporting policy and legislative reforms for
functional, fiscal and administrative decentralization that clarify and enhance
the role of local government, its relationship to central government, and as a
means to improve local service delivery.



Outcome 1 will focus on policy
and legal frameworks across Somalia
and is initially designed to address weaknesses in current laws on
decentralization in Somaliland and
Puntland. These provide an incomplete
account of the responsibilities and functions to be devolved to local
government, ignore the fiscal implications and lack supporting regulations for
implementation. These issues need to be
clarified in order to resolve disputes between central line agencies and
districts, and to provide a stronger foundation for local governments to move forward; 



2. Improving local government capacity for
equitable service delivery.



Outcome 2 aims to address the
weak capacity of most local authorities in Somalia by providing a
comprehensive package of training and technical support covering basic elements
of local administration. It also seeks
to improve coordination between
districts and the
centre in planning
and programming to ensure
better consistency and use
of resources. A third output is concerned with increasing
locally generated revenues and strengthening the role and coverage of the LDF;
and, 



1.
Improving
and expanding the delivery of sustainable services to citizens in an equitable,
responsive and socially accountable manner and promoting local economic
environment.



Outcome 3 focuses on improving
the delivery of local services. This is
to be achieved by collaborating more closely with central line
departments, engaging more
directly with non-state
providers, and enhancing
the accountability of local governments to their constituents. Another
element relates to strengthening the local economy, promoting private
investment and enterprise, and creating more and better job opportunities. 



In all of these efforts, JPLG II recognizes the
paramount importance of respecting and promoting local ownership, commitment
and leadership. Without these ingredients,
the prospects of sustaining gains are substantially diminished. For this purpose, JPLG II will continue seek
support and political commitment at the highest
levels of Government,

The need has been identified for a low cost latrine emptying system
which could reach into areas with difficult access, could suck out the dense
wastes in latrine pits, transport the waste over short distances for disposal
and still be affordable to the small entrepreneurs who are providing services
in the unplanned peri-urban areas developing around Mogadishu. There is an
urgent need to deploy a system to redress the situation, but the proposed
system should however meet the following criteria:

·
Must be simple,
user friendly and cheap to maintain by local communities

·
Must uphold
hygiene standards both for the operators and the general public

·
Can be operated
as an income generating enterprise by the local communities and generated
revenue can be ploughed back to sustain and expand the project



To this end, UN-HABITAT proposes to pilot the Vacutug latrine pit
emptying technology in three IDP Camps in Mogadishu to support the work of
UNICEF, the WASH cluster and residents of the camps to provide an
environmentally sound sludge management system that can be replicated in other
similar situations. One Vacutug has a capacity of emptying up to about 10 tons
per day which translates into 30 tons if the proposed three units operate full
time. The Mogadishu IDP camps operate pit-latrines made of oil drums holding a
maximum of 200lts of sludge on full capacity, the proposed system will
therefore service up to about 150 latrines per day.



The proposed Mogadishu IDP
area sludge management project aims at establishing environmentally sustainable
and designated sludge disposal sites in collaboration with the Mogadishu
(Benadir) Regional Authority. 

UN-Habitat, in
collaboration with its local NGO partner and participating IDP area leadership
will engage the District and Regional authorities in Mogadishu, and ensure
their direct involvement in the project activities, particularly in relation to
the establishment and management of temporary and long-term sludge disposal. The
project ensures transition from emergency desludging measures to a sustainable
system for sludge removal, in collaboration with public authorities, the
private sector and community groups.



The main outcomes of the
project are:



·
A low-cost sludge management
strategy adopted and is working in the three IDP camps of Mogadishu in Somalia
under management by local communities. 

·
Local authority and the
communities in the IDP camps have the capacity to design, build and maintain
improved pit latrines and sludge disposal sites and management of mechanised
sludge disposal technology (i.e. Data records, established practices and
organizational arrangements from pilot project are used and fully incorporated
in the SECIL Project, for long-term sustainability)

to contribute to advance the coordinated implementation of the Habitat Agenda
and ensure that sustainable urban development is increasingly incorporated in
the political and media global Agenda. In particular the project, while
addressing the overall issue related to rapid urbanization with its challenges
and opportunities, seeks to contribute to bridge the existing gaps on:




 Lack of legitimated and effective global
     platforms for interaction and debates, exchange of experience and
     knowledge on sustainable urbanization
 Existent poor coordination and cooperation among
     different constituencies dealing with sustainable development
 Insufficient advocacy and awareness on
     sustainable urbanization, which if improved could be the key to include
     the subject in the global political and media agenda with the support of
     all partners




In
addition, the project seeks to contribute to raising the profile of UN-Habitat
as a leading agency in the field of urbanization, through the image building
potential of such a big United Nations conference, along with the consolidation
of its knowledge base and the incorporation of the conference outcomes in the strategies
and work of the agency from the normative to the operation level.



The main
target population of the project is constituted by decision makers like,
National and Local Government representatives, Parliamentarians, as well as other
actors like Intergovernmental organizations, academies, CSOs, women and youth,
professionals, private sector, foundations and general public. 

Decision
makers are supposed to benefit through their learning on how to make decisions
based on international best policies and practices, coordination mechanisms,
partnerships and synergies shared during the World Urban Forum. The same is
valid for the other categories of Habitat Agenda partners, including the
general public that has to influence, support and sustain the decision making
process. 



The
project responds to the real needs and priorities of target groups, creating
tailored spaces and activities for each category of partners as well as spaces
for interaction. In addition, a results oriented preparation and implementation
of the conference ensure that conclusions are drawn from the conference and
outcomes shared by all participants as well as brought to higher instances of
decision making.

In
particular the seventh session of the world urban forum will act as an
important “substantive input gathering” opportunity to successively feed the
on-going Post 2015 Development Agenda process as well as the Habitat III
preparation. 



UN-Habitat
will ensure that all thematic priority areas of its work are mainstreamed in
the main debates in order to put its knowledge base as well as its technical
and high level policy advisor, at the disposal of all participants and at the
same time feedbacks are collected for successive consolidation. 



The
active involvement and participation of all constituencies from the preparation
to the implementation including the phase of outcomes gathering, will be key
for the success of the project which seeks the central involvement of member
states of the governing body of UN-Habitat and more importantly the WUF7 host
country. 



The city of Medellin will also play a key role
not only to ensure an effective preparation of the conference but also as a
living urban laboratory open to participants, where several strategies and urban
tools are being implemented, and a clear model of sustainable urban development
is shown to the world. To this aim several physical and non-physical
interventions will be implemented in order to leave a tangible legacy to the

     sustainable urbanization, which if improved could be the key to include
     the subject in the global political and media agenda with the support of
     all partners




In
addition, the project seeks to contribute to raising the profile of UN-Habitat
as a leading agency in the field of urbanization, through the image building
potential of such a big United Nations conference, along with the consolidation
of its knowledge base and the incorporation of the conference outcomes in the strategies
and work of the agency from the normative to the operation level.



The main
target population of the project is constituted by decision makers like,
National and Local Government representatives, Parliamentarians, as well as other
actors like Intergovernmental organizations, academies, CSOs, women and youth,
professionals, private sector, foundations and general public. 

Decision
makers are supposed to benefit through their learning on how to make decisions
based on international best policies and practices, coordination mechanisms,
partnerships and synergies shared during the World Urban Forum. The same is
valid for the other categories of Habitat Agenda partners, including the
general public that has to influence, support and sustain the decision making
process. 



The
project responds to the real needs and priorities of target groups, creating
tailored spaces and activities for each category of partners as well as spaces
for interaction. In addition, a results oriented preparation and implementation
of the conference ensure that conclusions are drawn from the conference and
outcomes shared by all participants as well as brought to higher instances of
decision making.

In
particular the seventh session of the world urban forum will act as an
important “substantive input gathering” opportunity to successively feed the
on-going Post 2015 Development Agenda process as well as the Habitat III
preparation. 



UN-Habitat
will ensure that all thematic priority areas of its work are mainstreamed in
the main debates in order to put its knowledge base as well as its technical
and high level policy advisor, at the disposal of all participants and at the
same time feedbacks are collected for successive consolidation. 



The
active involvement and participation of all constituencies from the preparation
to the implementation including the phase of outcomes gathering, will be key
for the success of the project which seeks the central involvement of member
states of the governing body of UN-Habitat and more importantly the WUF7 host
country. 



The city of Medellin will also play a key role
not only to ensure an effective preparation of the conference but also as a
living urban laboratory open to participants, where several strategies and urban
tools are being implemented, and a clear model of sustainable urban development
is shown to the world. To this aim several physical and non-physical
interventions will be implemented in order to leave a tangible legacy to the
host city and its citizens.",2,2013-04-01,2015-04-30,,,,,,,Municipality of Medellin,,,,,,,,,,,,WW,,100,998,"Developing countries, unspecified",,22010;43082,Communications policy and administrative management;Research/scientific institutions,;,OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee,DAC;DAC,1,110,20,CO1,CO1

The purpose of the programme is to 1. Increase capacity to provide emergency shelter assistance and essential services
for affected people in Syria 

2.Enhance the operational capacity of national and international
humanitarian responders and support existing local and community coping mechanisms.


Population and geographical targets:

The project has the following population and Geographical
targets:

Neighbourhood
coordination and community contracting:

·
Geographical target: City of Homs

·
Neighbourhoods: 2 neighbourhoods agreed by
stakeholders between population of 20,000 to 80,000 chosen for the pilot
approach 

Target
beneficiaries: 20
communities @ 500 families each (5000 families per neighbourhood). Total 50,000
direct beneficiaries's targeted in two neighbourhoods

Shelter sector
support

Geographical
target cities for Shelter assessment, housing damage assessment and Rapid City
profiles: City of Homs, Aleppo, Lattakia and Jaramana (Rural Damascus). Homs,
Aleppo and Rural Damascus Governorates have the highest number of IDPs.

Target beneficiaries: Atleast 50,000 in each city. Total target of
people reached 200,000 for 4 shelter assessments. 

Geographical
target for municipal shelter coordination:
Municipal coordination: City of Homs and Aleppo to coordinate at least 30 shelter actors in each city
including local authorities and respective technical departments, private
sector, charities and national NGOsin each city.

Families indirectly benefitting with improved shelters through shelter
strategy and options: Target 200,000.Outcome 1

Improved emergency response for communities and coordination at city and
neighbourhood level with local stakeholders

This outcome and result focuses upon building coordination support for
emergency response in affected cities and urban centres in Syria and responding
to priority emergency needs on community based prioritized set of projects in 2
neighborhoods. A UN humanitarian coordination framework for multi sectoral
purposes will be developed at Damascus level and piloted in the city of Homs.
Results and experience will lead to scaling up the approach in Syria in other
key locations. The primary objective of
developing a coordination framework for UN country team is to decentralize
humanitarian coordination at neighbourhood and city level to be as close as
possible to communities, municipalities and neighborhoods. Technical assistance to local partners on
defining recovery and response in key sectors is part of the pilot. The city of
Homs is proposed as a pilot due to the growing humanitarian needs, presence of
UN operational hub and a large number of actors that need to be coordinated to
leverage capacities. Coordination will take place in two neighborhoods as a
pilot where actors covering basic services, health education, shelter and other
areas will be convened together to promote coordination in an integrated
manner. 



The city scale is comprised of two levels: The neighborhoods in Syrian
cities are often an area comprising population between 2.000 and up to 250.000
inhabitants. The two neighborhoods and communities will be selected through
local community meetings with community based organizations, IDPs and community
members. The goal is to choose one neighbourhood each in Government and
opposition controlled areas to begin neighbourhood emergency response planning in
these affected neighborhoods. Since the neighborhoods in Syria are normally
dense and are currently hosting large numbers of IDPs, local emergency action
plans for each neighbourhood will be further divided into 20 communities as
units.



Providing access to public services as education or healthcare as well
as ensuring functioning basic infrastructure services of water, sanitation,
waste collection and energy can protect people from further deprivation and
violence by reducing immediate risks. The local emergency plans will identify
local community initiatives to be supported in 20 communities during the
project duration. 



Capacities of local NGO, Syrian Arab Red Crescent and community based
organizations will be strengthened in this process. Neighbourhood based local
emergency plans will facilitate decision making, consensus, prioritization of
efforts already taking place or in need of support. 



Outcome 2 

Increased availability of shelter needs assessment data, municipal
shelter coordination and strategy among sector partners Syria has 14
Governorates and each Governorate includes a range of districts, administrative
units as towns and cities. Currently IDPs are sheltering in informal shelters, public
and private buildings, rental accommodation, unfinished and sub-standard private
apartments and vacant places and slightly damaged houses. However the largest numbers
of Syrian IDPs are being hosted by friends, families, neighbors and relatives.
In addition, vacant houses in areas where people have left for other cities are
in use by IDPs. Current response to shelter needs is based on Government
managed collective centres where over 800 shelters are targeted covering less
than 5% of IDP population across Syria. UN-Habitat's added comparative
advantage in the shelter sector working group will be to understand the needs
of the remaining 95% percent IDPs and develop shelter support options for short
and medium term response. As no data and assessment for the sector is
available, SDC funding will be utilized to develop shelter needs and housing damage
assessments in 4 pilot cities by launching the assessment and developing a
strategy in cooperation with shelter sector leads and partners. 

Municipal shelter
coordination and strategy for the city will be improved through leading two municipal
pilots in select cities of Aleppo and Homs. The pilots will reinforce and
establish shelter coordination and information capacity in the municipal
technical services departments. Aleppo city is selected due to the scale of displacement
and IDPs residing across the city in dormitories, public and private buildings,
slightly damaged houses, host families and rental apartments and make shift
shelters. Whereas city of Homs, the third largest city in Syria, is a UN hub
and lacks shelter coordination and strategy among municipal authorities and
shelter partners. 

The key specific strategic
results will be as follows: a) increased municipal shelter coordination among
local authorities, technical services departments, NGOs, charities, private
sector, engineering and architecture related professional bodies and communities;
b) development of shelter packages and options in cooperation with shelter
sector partners particularly for host families, IDPs in informal shelters and
in need of upgrading or new shelter options and repair related support, and; c)
development of an overview of cities, displacement and hosting support, and
shelter, infrastructure and basic services needs through rapid city profiles.

This strategic outcome
will support the development of the next SHARP for 2014 and support for
additional shelter response options beyond collective centres only. The
analysis and outcome of 4 shelter assessments, housing damage assessment and
rapid profiles will lead to development of short to medium term solutions,
options and strategy for the sector. During field visits by members of shelter
working group, gaps in shelter
options and availability of shelter and housing packages to support IDPs
residing in various shelter conditions are supported by the shelter sector.
Shelter packages must also address upgrading support and site management that
will be required for both private finished and buildings and host communities. 

Outcome 3

Increased knowledge and technical
resources available to shelter sector stakeholders on addressing immediate shelter
needs



While technical capacities in development sector including engineering,
architecture and physical planning are strong in Syria, these actors are not substantively
engaged in coordinated emergency shelter response although more recently the
Engineers Syndicates have become engaged. Lack of appropriate and affordable
framework for addressing needs of Syria's urban population has historically contributed
to significant informal construction practices. Around 40% of housing in urban
areas is informal. There has been limited attention to the importance of gender
issues in urban planning and development, and limited experience in pro-poor
housing approaches. Understanding of environmental issues is however better
developed and practices on historic conservation are well developed
particularly as a result of GIZ's technical assistance.

Issues of community participation, gender, environment and pro-poor
housing form the backbone to inclusive reconstruction. Current knowledge gaps
and lack of appropriate practices in this area will be a major constraint in
securing a housing rehabilitation and reconstruction process that is conducive
to addressing causal issues of the Syrian crisis, unless capacities can be
built amongst key urban civil society stakeholders (professionals, academics,
private sector and communities) and local government on such issues. 

Building on the results of Outcome 2, local expert inputs, better
understanding of environmental and gender issues related to housing as well as
issues of informality, the project will provide technical resources and
strategies to guide the shelter sector in providing appropriate shelter
solutions.

The purpose of the programme is to 1. Increase capacity to provide emergency shelter assistance and essential services
for affected people in Syria 

2.Enhance the operational capacity of national and international
humanitarian responders and support existing local and community coping mechanisms.


Population and geographical targets:

The project has the following population and Geographical
targets:

Neighbourhood
coordination and community contracting:

·
Geographical target: City of Homs

·
Neighbourhoods: 2 neighbourhoods agreed by
stakeholders between population of 20,000 to 80,000 chosen for the pilot
approach 

Target
beneficiaries: 20
communities @ 500 families each (5000 families per neighbourhood). Total 50,000
direct beneficiaries's targeted in two neighbourhoods

Shelter sector
support

Geographical
target cities for Shelter assessment, housing damage assessment and Rapid City
profiles: City of Homs, Aleppo, Lattakia and Jaramana (Rural Damascus). Homs,
Aleppo and Rural Damascus Governorates have the highest number of IDPs.

Target beneficiaries: Atleast 50,000 in each city. Total target of
people reached 200,000 for 4 shelter assessments. 

Geographical
target for municipal shelter coordination:
Municipal coordination: City of Homs and Aleppo to coordinate at least 30 shelter actors in each city
including local authorities and respective technical departments, private
sector, charities and national NGOsin each city.

Families indirectly benefitting with improved shelters through shelter
strategy and options: Target 200,000.Outcome 1

Improved emergency response for communities and coordination at city and
neighbourhood level with local stakeholders

This outcome and result focuses upon building coordination support for
emergency response in affected cities and urban centres in Syria and responding
to priority emergency needs on community based prioritized set of projects in 2
neighborhoods. A UN humanitarian coordination framework for multi sectoral
purposes will be developed at Damascus level and piloted in the city of Homs.
Results and experience will lead to scaling up the approach in Syria in other
key locations. The primary objective of
developing a coordination framework for UN country team is to decentralize
humanitarian coordination at neighbourhood and city level to be as close as
possible to communities, municipalities and neighborhoods. Technical assistance to local partners on
defining recovery and response in key sectors is part of the pilot. The city of
Homs is proposed as a pilot due to the growing humanitarian needs, presence of
UN operational hub and a large number of actors that need to be coordinated to
leverage capacities. Coordination will take place in two neighborhoods as a
pilot where actors covering basic services, health education, shelter and other
areas will be convened together to promote coordination in an integrated
manner. 



The city scale is comprised of two levels: The neighborhoods in Syrian
cities are often an area comprising population between 2.000 and up to 250.000
inhabitants. The two neighborhoods and communities will be selected through
local community meetings with community based organizations, IDPs and community
members. The goal is to choose one neighbourhood each in Government and
opposition controlled areas to begin neighbourhood emergency response planning in
these affected neighborhoods. Since the neighborhoods in Syria are normally
dense and are currently hosting large numbers of IDPs, local emergency action
plans for each neighbourhood will be further divided into 20 communities as
units.



Providing access to public services as education or healthcare as well
as ensuring functioning basic infrastructure services of water, sanitation,
waste collection and energy can protect people from further deprivation and
violence by reducing immediate risks. The local emergency plans will identify
local community initiatives to be supported in 20 communities during the
project duration. 



Capacities of local NGO, Syrian Arab Red Crescent and community based
organizations will be strengthened in this process. Neighbourhood based local
emergency plans will facilitate decision making, consensus, prioritization of
efforts already taking place or in need of support. 



Outcome 2 

Increased availability of shelter needs assessment data, municipal
shelter coordination and strategy among sector partners Syria has 14
Governorates and each Governorate includes a range of districts, administrative
units as towns and cities. Currently IDPs are sheltering in informal shelters, public
and private buildings, rental accommodation, unfinished and sub-standard private
apartments and vacant places and slightly damaged houses. However the largest numbers
of Syrian IDPs are being hosted by friends, families, neighbors and relatives.
In addition, vacant houses in areas where people have left for other cities are
in use by IDPs. Current response to shelter needs is based on Government
managed collective centres where over 800 shelters are targeted covering less
than 5% of IDP population across Syria. UN-Habitat's added comparative
advantage in the shelter sector working group will be to understand the needs
of the remaining 95% percent IDPs and develop shelter support options for short
and medium term response. As no data and assessment for the sector is
available, SDC funding will be utilized to develop shelter needs and housing damage
assessments in 4 pilot cities by launching the assessment and developing a
strategy in cooperation with shelter sector leads and partners. 

Municipal shelter
coordination and strategy for the city will be improved through leading two municipal
pilots in select cities of Aleppo and Homs. The pilots will reinforce and
establish shelter coordination and information capacity in the municipal
technical services departments. Aleppo city is selected due to the scale of displacement
and IDPs residing across the city in dormitories, public and private buildings,
slightly damaged houses, host families and rental apartments and make shift
shelters. Whereas city of Homs, the third largest city in Syria, is a UN hub
and lacks shelter coordination and strategy among municipal authorities and
shelter partners. 

The key specific strategic
results will be as follows: a) increased municipal shelter coordination among
local authorities, technical services departments, NGOs, charities, private
sector, engineering and architecture related professional bodies and communities;
b) development of shelter packages and options in cooperation with shelter
sector partners particularly for host families, IDPs in informal shelters and
in need of upgrading or new shelter options and repair related support, and; c)
development of an overview of cities, displacement and hosting support, and
shelter, infrastructure and basic services needs through rapid city profiles.

This strategic outcome
will support the development of the next SHARP for 2014 and support for
additional shelter response options beyond collective centres only. The
analysis and outcome of 4 shelter assessments, housing damage assessment and
rapid profiles will lead to development of short to medium term solutions,
options and strategy for the sector. During field visits by members of shelter
working group, gaps in shelter
options and availability of shelter and housing packages to support IDPs
residing in various shelter conditions are supported by the shelter sector.
Shelter packages must also address upgrading support and site management that
will be required for both private finished and buildings and host communities. 

Outcome 3

Increased knowledge and technical
resources available to shelter sector stakeholders on addressing immediate shelter
needs



While technical capacities in development sector including engineering,
architecture and physical planning are strong in Syria, these actors are not substantively
engaged in coordinated emergency shelter response although more recently the
Engineers Syndicates have become engaged. Lack of appropriate and affordable
framework for addressing needs of Syria's urban population has historically contributed
to significant informal construction practices. Around 40% of housing in urban
areas is informal. There has been limited attention to the importance of gender
issues in urban planning and development, and limited experience in pro-poor
housing approaches. Understanding of environmental issues is however better
developed and practices on historic conservation are well developed
particularly as a result of GIZ's technical assistance.

Issues of community participation, gender, environment and pro-poor
housing form the backbone to inclusive reconstruction. Current knowledge gaps
and lack of appropriate practices in this area will be a major constraint in
securing a housing rehabilitation and reconstruction process that is conducive
to addressing causal issues of the Syrian crisis, unless capacities can be
built amongst key urban civil society stakeholders (professionals, academics,
private sector and communities) and local government on such issues. 

Building on the results of Outcome 2, local expert inputs, better
understanding of environmental and gender issues related to housing as well as
issues of informality, the project will provide technical resources and
strategies to guide the shelter sector in providing appropriate shelter
solutions.

UN-Habitat Cities Prosperity Initiative is a strategic policy initiative for
cities and partners that are committed to aligning their policies, operations
and strategies with UN-Habitat's fresh notion of prosperity. Cities are expected to work simultaneously in
the five dimensions of prosperity: productivity, infrastructure, quality of
life, equity and environmental sustainability.




The City Prosperity Initiative is a practical
framework for the formulation, implementation, and monitoring of sustainability
policies and practices to increase prosperity levels at city level. It is an initiative that provides
collaborative solutions to the most fundamental challenges facing cities.



Specifically,
it is an Initiative of 250 cities globally that are committed to a more
holistic, people-centred and sustainable notion of prosperity and pledge to
deploy necessary efforts and resources to move forward in the prosperity path
will be created. The aim is to enable a shift away from prevailing narrow and
lopsided conceptualizations of prosperity and related policies and actions. The
rationale for this is that without a new and revised conceptualization of
prosperity at strategic policy levels, cities risk promoting strategies that
threaten rather than enhance sustainability.



By
estimating the City Prosperity Index (CPI) of cities based on globally
comparable data, UN-Habitat will create an invaluable baseline for tracking
progress in terms of prosperity. In addition, in conducting estimations in
cities through the Initiative, UN-Habitat will also adapt the CPI to correspond
to locally available data, policy priorities and needs. Thus, the Initiative
will enable globally comparable yet locally specific estimation and monitoring
of urban prosperity.



Three intermediate accomplishments of the Cities
Prosperity Initiative will be:

Improved policies and strategies of cities towards prosperity path
     are catalyzed through customised action plans.Cities begin to implement actions and policies to advance on a
     prosperity path based on a customised action plan. Cities have enhanced capacity to measure and monitor present and
     future progress towards the prosperity path.



At a more local level, the Cities
Prosperity Initiative aims at:

Reinforcing local capacities to increase economies of scale and
     agglomeration for improved wellbeing and prosperity through localized
     urban planning and design interventions.Assisting in implementing a variety of technical solutions for
     improving the functionality of the city and achieving sustainable urban
     form.Assisting in packaging projects through pre-feasibility studies and
     project viability for financing.

Following from the above, the expected outputs of the project are as follows:

1.Cities create
conditions to embark on actions and policies to advance in a path of prosperity

2.Cities begin
to implement actions and policies to advance in a path of prosperity based on a
tailored General Action Plan and related Road Map

3.Cities are
capable to monitor, measure and evaluate progress towards the prosperity path

The
City Prosperity Index, together with a conceptual matrix, the Wheel of
Prosperity, both of which are meant to facilitate designing of clear policy
interventions, will form the basis of the technical advisory package described
above. This is accompanied by additional technical support in a wide spectrum
of areas such as institutional analysis, strategic thinking, guidelines,
training and capacity development, monitoring tools, urban futures analysis,
and policy simulations all designed to help cities to advance on the prosperity
path in a more sustainable manner. 



UN-Habitat's
wheel of prosperity symbolizes the well-balanced development of the five
dimensions, the current condition of which is graphically represented in the
City Prosperity Index. The outer rim absorbs the cumulative forces transmitted
through the spokes the five dimensions of prosperity. At the centre is the hub
the local urban power functions, with four interrelated roles: ensuring the
prevalence of public over any other kind of interest; controlling the
direction, pace and momentum of the wheel; ensuring the balanced development of
the five spokes and associated synergies; and in a two-way relationship,
absorbing and amortizing any shocks transmitted by the spokes.







The
hub brings together the power functions (e.g., laws, regulations and
institutions, urban planning, civil society, trade associations, special
agencies, etc.) associated with the five spokes. In this role the hub
represents human agency in all its embodiments. Clearly therefore, the thematic
focus of the project is directly linked to and integrates all of UN-Habitat's
thematic priorities as symbolized by its 7 Branches. The operationalization of
the Cities Prosperity Initiative will involve all Branches of UN-Habitat given
the direct linkages between the five dimensions of the Wheel of Urban
Prosperity (productivity, urban infrastructure, quality of life, equity and
environmental sustainability) and ongoing work in UN-Habitat's thematic
Branches. Once the CPI is estimated for cities, UN-Habitat's Branches
will be fully engaged in the roll out of the Technical Advisory Package (see above)
especially in the diagnosis of prosperity challenges and opportunities to
prepare a general action plan and road map; identification of appropriate
innovative solutions, best practices, tools and guides to facilitate
operationalization of the general action plan and road map; and technical
advisory services to support the establishment of local monitoring mechanisms
to track progress on a path of prosperity. 



In
addition, UN-Habitat's regional offices and Habitat Programme Managers will
play a critical role in the operationalization of the Cities Prosperity
Initiative and related activities. Accordingly, using seed funding obtained
from the UN-Habitat Internal Development Fund, the recruitment of three
consultants to be located in UN-Habitat offices in Africa, Asia and Latin
America is already underway.



A
number of external partners will also play a critical role in the realization
of the objectives of the City Prosperity Initiative. These include local and
metropolitan authorities, urban development authorities, local and regional
academic, policy and research institutes, national and regional banks and
Habitat Professionals Associations. Furthermore, where available, UN-Habitat
will rely on Local Urban Observatories (LOUs) for gathering and processing data
for the estimation of CPIs. Moreover, LUOs will be used as a platform for
establishing specific prosperity monitoring mechanism for in each city.

land policies, especially in Asia and Africa.
Often it is not possible for these countries to implement pro-poor and gender
sensitive land policies, because the underlying tools and practices do not always
exist, or have not been sufficiently documented and disseminated. Emerging from
the 1990s some organizations and individuals have been trying to address this
issue, but have struggled with the scale of the challenge geographically and
conceptually. In essence, most developing countries use conventional land
administration systems which cover less than 30 percent of the country, leaving
up to 70 percent of citizens looking to informal and/or customary approaches
for their tenure security. 



Prior to GLTN launch in 2006, an analysis was conducted which drew
several important conclusions. First,
while there are many examples of good land policies, there are few policies
that have been fully implemented due to lack of pro-poor, gender-sensitive and
large-scale land tools. Second, a
conclusion was that conventional land titling approaches have largely failed to
deliver their expected results: existing technical solutions are too expensive,
inappropriate for the range of tenure found in developing countries,
unsustainable financially or in terms of available capacity, and instead a
range of land tenure options is more appropriate. Third, an agreement was that land sector work in country cannot be
done at scale successfully in many countries without the combination of various
underlying factors and strategies including better donor coordination,
strengthening partnerships of key land actors, capacity development initiatives
and continuous dialogues and
communications between and amongst key stakeholders including government (at
various levels), professionals, civil society groups, academia/research
institutions, grassroots and target communities themselves. 



To address these
challenges, UN-Habitat has taken the lead and facilitated the establishment of
the Global Land Tool Network that aims at contributing to poverty reduction and
to the achievement of MDGs through the development of pro-poor and gender
sensitive land tools to improve tenure security of the urban and rural poor
since its launch in 2006. GLTN Phase 1 has already achieved significant results
in its 4 years of operations as concluded by the independent mid-term
evaluation and echoed by various partners and land actors. For example, there
is now a growing paradigm shift towards the adoption of a pro-poor, gender
sensitive and large scale land tools, policies and approaches; as well as the
recognition of the need for a ‘continuum of land rights' to replace the more
conventional approaches of reliance on cadastre and individual titles. Global
discourse on key GLTN's tools and approaches are well captured by various
global and regional interventions. Examples include the following: World Bank
is taking the lead in the development of Land Governance and Administration
Framework (LGAF) globally; FAO is taking the lead in the development and implementation
by member-states of the Voluntary Guidelines on Responsible Governance on Tenure of Land, Forests and
Fisheries, wherein UN-Habitat has played a critical role, the adoption of the
African Land Policy Framework and Guidelines which was supported and adopted by
the Third African Ministerial Conference on Housing and Urban Development (AMCHUD)
and the Bamako Action Plan. 



Moreover, Phase 1 has
already developed significant land tools and training packages ready for
rolling out with partners at national and local government levels.
Some partners are already adopting these land tools for their use and for their
capacity development initiatives. For example, the gender evaluation criteria
tool has now been adopted by Huairou Commission for their implementation and training
for trainers (ToTs) will be conducted before the end of the year. Likewise, the
International Land Coalition has indicated that they would like to adopt and
implement the same on their country-level projects in various countries. Training
for land professionals on this tool has also started. As part of GLTN Phase 2,
the gender evaluation criteria will also be introduced and mainstreamed in UN-Habitat
operations particularly in providing in-country support to tool implementation
in targeted countries and/or cities/municipalities and the needed capacity development initiatives
will be undertaken. The Kenya
experience in land policy formulation, donor coordination and engagement with
non-state actors has been used as a model for other country's interventions by
UN-Habitat (e.g. DRC, Eastern Caribbean Island
States, South Sudan and Liberia). GLTN
partners from the academia and training institutions are now adopting the land
tools developed, concepts and training packages in their training and
educational curriculum. For example, ITC-Netherlands is now teaching the
concept and use of the Social Tenure Domain Model (STDM) – a pro-poor land
rights recording system to their Masters' Program while the Technical
University of Munich has been mobilizing resources to adopt some GLTN training
packages for their curriculum as well as for conducting the same training
sessions. GLTN's partnership with grassroots organizations has also yielded
some significant successes. Aside from understanding the underlying reasons why
good grassroots land projects have difficulties in going to scale, specific
experiences like that of Brazil resulted in the regularization of an estimated
55,000 slum dwellers.



While significant results have been achieved by GLTN Phase 1, a great
deal more work is required for gains made to be consolidated and extended. GLTN
Phase 2 will further expand its partnership and scope from its known
international partners to UN-Habitat staff and selected land programmes/projects.
It will also implement some of its priority land tools in targeted countries
and/or cities/municipalities in partnership with UN-Habitat's field projects
and/or international partners with their national and local networks,
particularly in regard to the agencies new priority areas of urban land,
legislations and governance. GLTN Phase 2, in close collaboration with UN-Habitat's
regional offices and field operations, and other partners will ensure that
in-country interventions will be within the framework of ‘One UN System' as
delivering as one and in accordance with the country's Poverty Reduction
Strategy Papers (PRSPs) and/or strategic plans. The key objective is to have
more change agents and champions that have the capacity and knowledge to
promote and implement land policies, tools and approaches that are pro-poor,
gender-sensitive, effective and sustainable to improve tenure security of the urban and rural poor. 



In this context, there is an urgent need and
increasing demand for GLTN to: continue its work; expand its brand and help
develop capacities of its partners (internal and external); and support the adoption
and implementation of pro-poor and gender appropriate land policies, tools and
approaches at national and local government levels through forging strategic
partnerships and piloting and working at country level.

They have been living for long years inside the Old City and hold the memory of the place.The project will provide to the residents of the targeted historical complex
a better living environment through rehabilitation works and eliminating the risk factors resulting from
living in deteriorated buildings.The rehabilitation works will address various
aspects and stages of decay, such as structural instability, unsafe electrical and
dysfunctional mechanical installations, humidity, inadequate lighting and
access difficulties, especially for the elderly.In addition, the resident families will enjoy a
good provision of open space that accommodates private courtyards, domestic
gardens of indigenous Palestinian local character, social and seasonal events.Meanwhile, the historical character of the
complex and the houses will be preserved.The project also addresses the problems of lack of social and community services for youth ,lack of variety in the commercial and Palestinian touristic attractions and services inside the Old City. In response to this, the project entails the rehabilitation of a vacant
decayed and deserted space on the ground floor of the targeted historical complex.The space will be
converted into a new civic center that will act as a hub for a diverse range of
visitors and youth of both genders.The action will comprise a package of activities
and commercial uses that will be unique and will fill a gap in the services
offered inside the Old City, hence create an attractive hub for its residents
and visitors alike. Hereby, the project will capitalize on the strategic
location of the premises -being adjacent to one of the centrally located market
areas inside the Old City (Khan Alzait) in the Islamic Quarter- and the
historic character of the complex to promote Palestinian identity. Hence, it
will counter act Israeli policies that aim at weakening the Palestinian
identity inside the Old City.In addition, the project addresses the problems of youth social problem, and the high rates of school dropouts.The civic center will include youth knowledge and
career guidance facilities. It will provide them with a space that is equipped
with modern tools of communication, knowledge gaining and self-expression. It
will also provide youth development programs that are focused on career
development and education guidance.

The design of the civic centre and its functional program
will cater for creating a spatial setting that allows the Palestinian youth of
both genders, who suffer from isolation and limited development choices to enjoy an attractive atmosphere of social and
cultural diverse interactions through
the center activities . The interaction will be directed to focus on learning
from Palestinian entrepreneurs, accomplished young professionals, and the
centre operation staff and global visitors. In addition, the operation plan of
the centre will accommodate regular events that focus on youth
development. 

The project will build on the experience, existing programs
and networks of Al Quds University to establish and operate the above mentioned
development programs. The program will include education and career guidance
specialized training, in addition to exposure and links to regional and
international capacity building initiatives and job opportunities. This will
help youth graduating from Palestinian universities to overcome some of the
barriers that narrow their perspective towards education and reduces their
access to rewarding jobs. Students who live in the Old City will be given preferential consideration for benefiting from the above
mentioned opportunities andactivities.Aclosely related matter to the above mentioned problems, is youth weak access to employment and jobopportunities. In this regards, the projectis anchored around engaging Palestinian
youth, in particular Palestinian students and newly graduating students from
Al-Quds University, in various stages of the development process. This will
allow for a capacity building model that enables the selected youth to gain
hands on experience. This will help bridging the existing gab resulting from
the weak economic activity and limited private investment, which minimize
employment opportunities and weaken Palestinian access to job opportunities. UN-Habitat
and Al Quds University will coordinate the selection of suitable courses and
students to participate in the project. The selected students will be provided
with the necessary training to perform the required tasks. They will also be
provided with sufficient explanation and exposure to the development cycle. Youth
engagement is perceived to be achieved by two tracks. On the one hand students
will be engaged through course work, under guidance from their teachers and UN-Habitat
specialized expertise in the preparation of the operation plan and its required
market surveys and needs assessment. On the other hand, new graduating students
will actively engage in practical training on the operation activities of the
center, in a manner that qualifies them to be hired directly by the project as
part of its operation staff as fixed staff or interns. This will expose the
selected students to the operation cycle, help them understand the business
aspect of it, and gain experience by actual practice

Furthermore , the center will act as
an incubator for career development where a job placement program will be
created to keep feeding additional students or interns to work in the center,
replacing other interns or trainees who were hired in a previous cycle of the
job placement program. Hence, the
capacity building cycle can keep repeating itself. The existing interns will be supported by
aiming at linking them with relevant job opportunities in other places.The project will utilize the significant historic value of the complex through adopting a rehabilitation approach that does not compete with the historic value, rather it enhances it with a sensitive layer of rehabilitation that suites contemporary requirements and responds to the specific needs of the residents, users and visitors. This will result in the creation of a convenient living environment, while maintaining the resident's sense of identity and pride.

They have been living for long years inside the Old City and hold the memory of the place.The project will provide to the residents of the targeted historical complex
a better living environment through rehabilitation works and eliminating the risk factors resulting from
living in deteriorated buildings.The rehabilitation works will address various
aspects and stages of decay, such as structural instability, unsafe electrical and
dysfunctional mechanical installations, humidity, inadequate lighting and
access difficulties, especially for the elderly.In addition, the resident families will enjoy a
good provision of open space that accommodates private courtyards, domestic
gardens of indigenous Palestinian local character, social and seasonal events.Meanwhile, the historical character of the
complex and the houses will be preserved.The project also addresses the problems of lack of social and community services for youth ,lack of variety in the commercial and Palestinian touristic attractions and services inside the Old City. In response to this, the project entails the rehabilitation of a vacant
decayed and deserted space on the ground floor of the targeted historical complex.The space will be
converted into a new civic center that will act as a hub for a diverse range of
visitors and youth of both genders.The action will comprise a package of activities
and commercial uses that will be unique and will fill a gap in the services
offered inside the Old City, hence create an attractive hub for its residents
and visitors alike. Hereby, the project will capitalize on the strategic
location of the premises -being adjacent to one of the centrally located market
areas inside the Old City (Khan Alzait) in the Islamic Quarter- and the
historic character of the complex to promote Palestinian identity. Hence, it
will counter act Israeli policies that aim at weakening the Palestinian
identity inside the Old City.In addition, the project addresses the problems of youth social problem, and the high rates of school dropouts.The civic center will include youth knowledge and
career guidance facilities. It will provide them with a space that is equipped
with modern tools of communication, knowledge gaining and self-expression. It
will also provide youth development programs that are focused on career
development and education guidance.

The design of the civic centre and its functional program
will cater for creating a spatial setting that allows the Palestinian youth of
both genders, who suffer from isolation and limited development choices to enjoy an attractive atmosphere of social and
cultural diverse interactions through
the center activities . The interaction will be directed to focus on learning
from Palestinian entrepreneurs, accomplished young professionals, and the
centre operation staff and global visitors. In addition, the operation plan of
the centre will accommodate regular events that focus on youth
development. 

The project will build on the experience, existing programs
and networks of Al Quds University to establish and operate the above mentioned
development programs. The program will include education and career guidance
specialized training, in addition to exposure and links to regional and
international capacity building initiatives and job opportunities. This will
help youth graduating from Palestinian universities to overcome some of the
barriers that narrow their perspective towards education and reduces their
access to rewarding jobs. Students who live in the Old City will be given preferential consideration for benefiting from the above
mentioned opportunities andactivities.Aclosely related matter to the above mentioned problems, is youth weak access to employment and jobopportunities. In this regards, the projectis anchored around engaging Palestinian
youth, in particular Palestinian students and newly graduating students from
Al-Quds University, in various stages of the development process. This will
allow for a capacity building model that enables the selected youth to gain
hands on experience. This will help bridging the existing gab resulting from
the weak economic activity and limited private investment, which minimize
employment opportunities and weaken Palestinian access to job opportunities. UN-Habitat
and Al Quds University will coordinate the selection of suitable courses and
students to participate in the project. The selected students will be provided
with the necessary training to perform the required tasks. They will also be
provided with sufficient explanation and exposure to the development cycle. Youth
engagement is perceived to be achieved by two tracks. On the one hand students
will be engaged through course work, under guidance from their teachers and UN-Habitat
specialized expertise in the preparation of the operation plan and its required
market surveys and needs assessment. On the other hand, new graduating students
will actively engage in practical training on the operation activities of the
center, in a manner that qualifies them to be hired directly by the project as
part of its operation staff as fixed staff or interns. This will expose the
selected students to the operation cycle, help them understand the business
aspect of it, and gain experience by actual practice

Furthermore , the center will act as
an incubator for career development where a job placement program will be
created to keep feeding additional students or interns to work in the center,
replacing other interns or trainees who were hired in a previous cycle of the
job placement program. Hence, the
capacity building cycle can keep repeating itself. The existing interns will be supported by
aiming at linking them with relevant job opportunities in other places.The project will utilize the significant historic value of the complex through adopting a rehabilitation approach that does not compete with the historic value, rather it enhances it with a sensitive layer of rehabilitation that suites contemporary requirements and responds to the specific needs of the residents, users and visitors.

The overall objective of JPGL II is to promote
improvements in local governance quality that can contribute to peace
consolidation, development and equitable service delivery. For JPLG's overall
objective to be realised, a number of agents
will have to
promote change that
can alter the
status quo in
a direction that
fosters a stronger, more
responsive and accountable
compact between the
state and its
citizens in the
provision of service delivery.
Despite progress the
current context is
still characterised by
limited trust in
government structures at both central and local levels, which in turn
means that their legitimacy is often contested.
This can increase the
risk of a
return to instability
and conflict. Moreover, the political space is still limited especially in southern areas, where
radical groups restrict the voice of many, including women. There is thus
a need
to consolidate and
enlarge the space
for non-state actors
in the rest
of Somalia and
to restore a healthy and accountable state citizen
nexus. 



To achieve the overall objective of JPLG II, the
programme outcomes are structured around three mutually reinforcing
strategies: 



1. Supporting policy and legislative reforms for
functional, fiscal and administrative decentralization that clarify and enhance
the role of local government, its relationship to central government, and as a
means to improve local service delivery.



Outcome 1 will focus on policy
and legal frameworks across Somalia
and is initially designed to address weaknesses in current laws on
decentralization in Somaliland and
Puntland. These provide an incomplete
account of the responsibilities and functions to be devolved to local
government, ignore the fiscal implications and lack supporting regulations for
implementation. These issues need to be
clarified in order to resolve disputes between central line agencies and
districts, and to provide a stronger foundation for local governments to move forward; 



2. Improving local government capacity for
equitable service delivery.



Outcome 2 aims to address the
weak capacity of most local authorities in Somalia by providing a
comprehensive package of training and technical support covering basic elements
of local administration. It also seeks
to improve coordination between
districts and the
centre in planning
and programming to ensure
better consistency and use
of resources. A third output is concerned with increasing
locally generated revenues and strengthening the role and coverage of the LDF;
and, 



1.
Improving
and expanding the delivery of sustainable services to citizens in an equitable,
responsive and socially accountable manner and promoting local economic
environment.



Outcome 3 focuses on improving
the delivery of local services. This is
to be achieved by collaborating more closely with central line
departments, engaging more
directly with non-state
providers, and enhancing
the accountability of local governments to their constituents. Another
element relates to strengthening the local economy, promoting private
investment and enterprise, and creating more and better job opportunities. 



In all of these efforts, JPLG II recognizes the
paramount importance of respecting and promoting local ownership, commitment
and leadership. Without these ingredients,
the prospects of sustaining gains are substantially diminished. For this purpose, JPLG II will continue seek
support and political commitment at the highest
levels of Government,

Consistent with Ghana's aspirations, the vision and collective programme of the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) for the period 2012-2016 seeks to advance a coherent vision for the UN system in support of key priorities of the Government's Development Agenda. The UNDAF aligns with the Ghana Shared Growth and Development Agenda (GSGDA) through four thematic areas[1] including infrastructure and human settlements development. WASH is an UNDAF outcome area under the infrastructure and human settlements development thematic area. The 2012-2016 UNDAF includes a key programme component on water, sanitation and hygiene to be implemented in the 5 most deprived regions (Central, Northern, Upper East, Upper West and Volta) of Ghana. The UNDAF Action Plan (UAP) puts some focus on the poorest regions of the country, in particular the activities of the Joint UN Office in Tamale, which focuses on the three northern regions, and includes support to disaster prone communities in these three regions.
Natural disaster occurrence in Ghana consists of droughts, epidemic outbreaks, floods, and wildfires. In the 3 Northern regions, disasters significantly impact vulnerable populations in disaster prone areas, and may lead to unnecessary losses of social and economic capital. In particular, recurrent flooding events, which are the most pervasive in terms of financial damages and numbers of people affected, usually result in the disruption of services from WASH facilities, which could lead to significant damages to property and trigger other emergency situations such as outbreaks of diarrhea, cholera, and other water related/borne diseases. The combination of these effects reduces the productivity of the population and the losses they suffer are immense and seriously affect their economic and social circumstances. These events tend to have devastating effects on the development of affected communities. 
Having to ensure that when such floods occur the quality of water supply is not contaminated (during collection, handling, storage, and use) also presents immense challenges to the health of these communities. Rehabilitation costs are usually unaffordable and communities have suffered a drastic fall in their living conditions and opportunities for future development, pushing them further into poverty and deprivation. 
The situation is further aggravated in those communities where there is a lack of WASH facilities and services. In such circumstances, the challenges include the prevalence of water borne, vector borne and sanitation related diseases as a result of poor drinking water quality and inadequate sanitation. Women, children and the youth suffer the most from the effects of this lack of access to WASH facilities and related services. Initiatives that address and improve the WASH situation for people in disaster prone communities contribute significantly to address most MDGs.
In a recent report, the National Disaster Monitoring Organization (NADMO) indicated that it had taken a census of people living in flood prone areas of the country, including the northern regions, and had allocated safe havens in these communities to prepare for the onset of the major rains. 
The project will work in close collaboration with NADMO in this context, and contribute to WASH components with respect to prior preparations towards mitigating disaster events, make recommendations for interventions during such events, and implement WASH solutions that could be resilient to the effects in the disaster prone communities.

1.1 Imbalance in economic production 

Sri Lanka's economy is characterized by substantial regional imbalances and the economic production is heavily concentrated in the Western Province, which accounts for 45 percent of the GDP whilst containing only 28 per cent of the country's population. The second and third highest contributions to GDP are from the Southern Province at 11.1 percent and from Central Province at 9.8 percent. The Northern Province (3.7 percent) and Uva Province (4.5 percent) record the lowest current GDP contribution .

1.4 Number of human deaths due to wild elephant attacks
Sri Lanka is one the thirteen Asian elephant range states and it is recorded that over 5879 wild elephants are in the country . According to the Department of Wildlife, Sri Lanka has the highest density of Wild Elephants in Asian Continent.  In this scenario, Human Elephant Conflicts (HEC) are bound to arise and continue.  According to Department of Wildlife Conservation records, during the period of 2005-2009 an annual average of 70 humans and 185 elephant deaths were reported. In 2012, 73 people and 257 elephants have been killed.  A simultaneous increase is also recorded in the number of injured farmers and serious damage to agricultural crops, houses and other properties. 
The villages which are isolated and neighboring to forest with elephant habitat face serious challenges Protecting their crops, properties and mobility of people. 

2. Project Objectives, Activities and Outputs 

2.1 Objective 1: Improving living conditions of returnees and other conflict affected people through restoration of community infrastructure and building disaster resilient communities

Activity 1.1: Community Mobilization
Firstly, in mobilizing communities, building awareness of why it is important to work together and how to organize and what the project is about is carried contacting community representatives and holding small group meetings to discuss 1) community assets, resources and issues 2) problems and their causes, 3) assess the capacity of existing CBO's and the feasibility of establishing a new one, 4) generate demand for a large community meeting.

Assisted by UN-Habitat, a community holds a large community meeting to discuss the status of existing CBO's and to identify capacity gaps or to establish a new CBO. Emphasis is given for representation of women and vulnerable members in the CBO.  In the case where an existing CBO is recognized and well represented by the community, project activities will be carried out with that CBO. In places where there is no representative CBO, UN-Habitat will facilitate the election of a CBO and having it registered with the local authority.

Activity 1.2: Preparation of Community Action Plans 

Facilitated by UN-Habitat, the CBO prepares the Community Action Plan (CAP) for infrastructure. Community Action Planning is a structured process where the community identifies their vulnerabilities and needs in terms of social, economic and physical infrastructure needs. Then they prioritize the needs and plan how to address them taking to consideration options and trade-offs. Finally the plan is presented to all the community members to discus and   to be endorsed. UN-Habitat has developed guidelines to conduct Community Action Planning.

Activity 1.3: Community Contracting
UN-Habitat together with CBO prepares the detail designs of infrastructure projects with cost estimates based on the CAP. Then project proposals are prepared and obtains endorsement of the community members. Then UN-Habitat awards a community contract to the CBO for project implementation.

Activity 1.4: Implementation and Monitoring 
Following the formalization of the community contracts, the construction /implementation of the projects identified will commence. The community, through the CBO, will monitor the progress.  UN-Habitat project technical personnel will provide technical advice on construction to maintain quality and standards. The project will introduce DRR features and standards in all construction work and provide advocacy and knowledge on DRR at the local level by incorporation in all training programmes. The Project will also introduce DRR guidelines and manuals for community construction based on ongoing UN-Habitat DRR initiatives. Training on eco-friendly construction techniques will be conducted to staff, community leaders and stakeholders.

Output 1.1.1: 90 Community Based Organizations mobilized
Output 1.2.1: 90 Community Action Plans for infrastructure prepared
Output 1.2.2: 900 Community members trained in community action planning
Output 1.3.1: 50 Community Contracts Awarded
Output 1.4.1: Reconstruction of 18 Multipurpose Community Centers

The multi-purpose community centers will consist of a community meeting hall, space for conducting mobile health clinics and community consultation areas for grassroots level government officials, agricultural extension officers and family health workers to cater to community needs. These facilities will allow the community to receive support on health and hygiene needs, social services assistance and direct support for their general agricultural needs from the Government. These centers will have toilets and rainwater harvesting facilities. They will be constructed through a community contracting process with resources provided by the Project. The community will take ownership of these assets and will receive training on operations and maintenance. 

Output 1.4.2: Construction of 10 rainwater harvesting facilities in public buildings
The project will construct rainwater harvesting facilities in selected public buildings in the target villages. Implementation will conform to the guidelines and standards of the National Rainwater Harvesting Policy, and targeted at enhancing the availability of water supply in order to improve the general living conditions of the community. In addition, rainwater harvesting facilities will also be installed in all new public buildings constructed under this project, making a total of 46 rainwater harvesting systems installed.

Output 1.4.3: Construction of 18 Preschools
District rehabilitation plans developed by the government district administration have prioritized the construction of pre-schools in the Northern Province, particularly in the districts of Killinochchi and Mullaitivu. It is also observed that a large number of villages which are geographically isolated preclude the attendance of children to preschools. This project will identify the 18 most vulnerable villages with a significant child population and build pre-school facilities and train preschool teachers from within the same community. While pre-schools will support the development of children, they will also result in women (housewives / mothers) having more free time to engage in livelihood opportunities.

Output 1.4.4: Diploma course for 36 pre-school teachers and the potential teachers in the community for 18 preschools 
The project will also provide the pre-school training for teachers of the 18 proposed pre-schools. The training will include material in all three languages in keeping with the tri-lingual policy of the Government 

Output 1.4.5: 90 Communities Resilient to Disaster with Improved Environment established
-	Reconstruction of 10 km of storm water drainage
The Northern and Eastern Provinces experiences serious flooding during the monsoon season, leading to inundation of roads and low lying areas. The project will initiate the construction of approximately 10 km of storm water drains. The community will be trained on maintaining the drains.
-	Disaster risk reduction (DRR) features to be incorporated into the construction of all community infrastructure 

-	63,500 trees planted by the communities

The communities will be engaged in environmental improvements through campaigns for tree planting for home gardening, on road sides and public places to increase the green cover in the villages, thereby mitigating the reduction of trees due to ongoing construction work and increased timber usage at the local level. The project aims to plant 63,500 trees through community actions and to promote edible, fruit bearing plants in order to promote food security and livelihood activities.

Output 1.4.6: Community and stakeholder capacities built to ensure sustainable operation and maintenance of rehabilitated infrastructure and facilities 

The project will conduct training in basic construction skills for youth. The training will assist the communities, in the short term, to overcome the shortage of skilled labour for infrastructure construction. There will be two methods of training for the youth in the target group. Firstly, those with sufficient educational qualifications as required by the formal training systems will be enrolled for construction based vocational training. Secondly, training will be conducted to include those who do not have basic educational qualifications in an apprenticeship programme under a master craftsman.

1.4 Number of human deaths due to wild elephant attacks
Sri Lanka is one the thirteen Asian elephant range states and it is recorded that over 5879 wild elephants are in the country . According to the Department of Wildlife, Sri Lanka has the highest density of Wild Elephants in Asian Continent.  In this scenario, Human Elephant Conflicts (HEC) are bound to arise and continue.  According to Department of Wildlife Conservation records, during the period of 2005-2009 an annual average of 70 humans and 185 elephant deaths were reported. In 2012, 73 people and 257 elephants have been killed.  A simultaneous increase is also recorded in the number of injured farmers and serious damage to agricultural crops, houses and other properties. 
The villages which are isolated and neighboring to forest with elephant habitat face serious challenges Protecting their crops, properties and mobility of people. 

2. Project Objectives, Activities and Outputs 

2.1 Objective 1: Improving living conditions of returnees and other conflict affected people through restoration of community infrastructure and building disaster resilient communities

Activity 1.1: Community Mobilization
Firstly, in mobilizing communities, building awareness of why it is important to work together and how to organize and what the project is about is carried contacting community representatives and holding small group meetings to discuss 1) community assets, resources and issues 2) problems and their causes, 3) assess the capacity of existing CBO's and the feasibility of establishing a new one, 4) generate demand for a large community meeting.

Assisted by UN-Habitat, a community holds a large community meeting to discuss the status of existing CBO's and to identify capacity gaps or to establish a new CBO. Emphasis is given for representation of women and vulnerable members in the CBO.  In the case where an existing CBO is recognized and well represented by the community, project activities will be carried out with that CBO. In places where there is no representative CBO, UN-Habitat will facilitate the election of a CBO and having it registered with the local authority.

Activity 1.2: Preparation of Community Action Plans 

Facilitated by UN-Habitat, the CBO prepares the Community Action Plan (CAP) for infrastructure. Community Action Planning is a structured process where the community identifies their vulnerabilities and needs in terms of social, economic and physical infrastructure needs. Then they prioritize the needs and plan how to address them taking to consideration options and trade-offs. Finally the plan is presented to all the community members to discus and   to be endorsed. UN-Habitat has developed guidelines to conduct Community Action Planning.

Activity 1.3: Community Contracting
UN-Habitat together with CBO prepares the detail designs of infrastructure projects with cost estimates based on the CAP. Then project proposals are prepared and obtains endorsement of the community members. Then UN-Habitat awards a community contract to the CBO for project implementation.

Activity 1.4: Implementation and Monitoring 
Following the formalization of the community contracts, the construction /implementation of the projects identified will commence. The community, through the CBO, will monitor the progress.  UN-Habitat project technical personnel will provide technical advice on construction to maintain quality and standards. The project will introduce DRR features and standards in all construction work and provide advocacy and knowledge on DRR at the local level by incorporation in all training programmes. The Project will also introduce DRR guidelines and manuals for community construction based on ongoing UN-Habitat DRR initiatives. Training on eco-friendly construction techniques will be conducted to staff, community leaders and stakeholders.

Output 1.1.1: 90 Community Based Organizations mobilized
Output 1.2.1: 90 Community Action Plans for infrastructure prepared
Output 1.2.2: 900 Community members trained in community action planning
Output 1.3.1: 50 Community Contracts Awarded
Output 1.4.1: Reconstruction of 18 Multipurpose Community Centers

The multi-purpose community centers will consist of a community meeting hall, space for conducting mobile health clinics and community consultation areas for grassroots level government officials, agricultural extension officers and family health workers to cater to community needs. These facilities will allow the community to receive support on health and hygiene needs, social services assistance and direct support for their general agricultural needs from the Government. These centers will have toilets and rainwater harvesting facilities. They will be constructed through a community contracting process with resources provided by the Project. The community will take ownership of these assets and will receive training on operations and maintenance. 

Output 1.4.2: Construction of 10 rainwater harvesting facilities in public buildings
The project will construct rainwater harvesting facilities in selected public buildings in the target villages. Implementation will conform to the guidelines and standards of the National Rainwater Harvesting Policy, and targeted at enhancing the availability of water supply in order to improve the general living conditions of the community. In addition, rainwater harvesting facilities will also be installed in all new public buildings constructed under this project, making a total of 46 rainwater harvesting systems installed.

Output 1.4.3: Construction of 18 Preschools
District rehabilitation plans developed by the government district administration have prioritized the construction of pre-schools in the Northern Province, particularly in the districts of Killinochchi and Mullaitivu. It is also observed that a large number of villages which are geographically isolated preclude the attendance of children to preschools. This project will identify the 18 most vulnerable villages with a significant child population and build pre-school facilities and train preschool teachers from within the same community. While pre-schools will support the development of children, they will also result in women (housewives / mothers) having more free time to engage in livelihood opportunities.

Output 1.4.4: Diploma course for 36 pre-school teachers and the potential teachers in the community for 18 preschools 
The project will also provide the pre-school training for teachers of the 18 proposed pre-schools. The training will include material in all three languages in keeping with the tri-lingual policy of the Government 

Output 1.4.5: 90 Communities Resilient to Disaster with Improved Environment established
-	Reconstruction of 10 km of storm water drainage
The Northern and Eastern Provinces experiences serious flooding during the monsoon season, leading to inundation of roads and low lying areas. The project will initiate the construction of approximately 10 km of storm water drains. The community will be trained on maintaining the drains.
-	Disaster risk reduction (DRR) features to be incorporated into the construction of all community infrastructure 

-	63,500 trees planted by the communities

The communities will be engaged in environmental improvements through campaigns for tree planting for home gardening, on road sides and public places to increase the green cover in the villages, thereby mitigating the reduction of trees due to ongoing construction work and increased timber usage at the local level. The project aims to plant 63,500 trees through community actions and to promote edible, fruit bearing plants in order to promote food security and livelihood activities.

Output 1.4.6: Community and stakeholder capacities built to ensure sustainable operation and maintenance of rehabilitated infrastructure and facilities 

The project will conduct training in basic construction skills for youth. The training will assist the communities, in the short term, to overcome the shortage of skilled labour for infrastructure construction. There will be two methods of training for the youth in the target group. Firstly, those with sufficient educational qualifications as required by the formal training systems will be enrolled for construction based vocational training. Secondly, training will be conducted to include those who do not have basic educational qualifications in an apprenticeship programme under a master craftsman. Trainees will be able, in both the long and short-term, to use the training acquired through the project to improve their livelihood opportunities and family incomes.

Following the July 2006 Israeli war, UN-Habitat Lebanon implemented a project titled “Good governance for enhanced post-war reconstruction in South Lebanon” which aimed at enhancing the capacities of affected families and municipalities to better manage the reconstruction process. Within this project, three Regional Technical Offices (RTOs) were established in three targeted Unions of Municipalities (UoMs); Tyre, Bint Jbeil and Jabal Amel. The RTO's engineers and field officers, being part of the local communities, were able, in a short period of time, to mobilize and immediately provide assistance to affected families as well as to concerned municipalities. By assisting the municipalities with rapid technical assessments of the buildings needing reconstruction work, and providing information and guidelines for house owners with ABCs in repair work, the RTOs contributed to a broad and swift rehabilitation process with the local actors at the steering wheel. 


Based on the previous experience UN-Habitat now replicates the RTO model to support the efforts of providing shelter and services for Syrian refugees as well as meeting the needs of the house communities, by enhancing the role of local authorities. In the first pilot phase two RTOs will be established under the mandate of two Unions of Municipalities within the Saida/Zahrani and Chouf districts. After the pilot RTOs are put in place and anticipated system and mechanisms tested, the approach will be applied in more Unions with further geographical outreach. The aim is to establish a model that could work within all Unions of Municipalities in Lebanon, covering more than 800 of the 1000 Municipalities in the country. To ensure that the project is able to rapidly apply the model in new Unions, a second batch of another three Unions of Municipalities is identified. 
This proposed Project, with a focus on enhancing the involvement of municipalities in responding to the needs of Syrian refugees, would i) complement the efforts of the Government, UNHCR, and other UN, national and international agencies, ii) accelerate the assistance process addressed to refugees, and iii) reduce the tension between host communities and refugees.The goal of the project is to respond to the immediate needs of Syrian refugees and host communities in different areas of Lebanon while laying the foundation for medium and long term sustainable solutions. 

In line with the project goal, the proposed action is planned to achieve two main objectives: 
- Accelerate the accommodation process of refugee families through the active involvement of municipalities and unions of municipalities in identifying, assessing and facilitating sound shelter facilities that comply with UNHCR standards and norms. 
- Support host communities through the implementation of sound projects that would respond to community groups needs and would enhance the delivery of basic urban services taking into account the existing and forthcoming numbers of refugees.


The strategy would include the following:
At the national level, UN-Habitat has been coordinating and will continue collaboration with UNHCR, the Ministry of Social Affairs (MoSA), the Ministry of Interior and Municipalities (MoIM) and other concerned governmental institutions and International agencies. This is being done through taking part in donor meetings as well as working groups, mainly shelter and WASH, and inter-agency meetings.
At the regional levels, in addition to municipalities and unions of municipalities, bureaus and representatives of government and international and UN agencies would constantly be engaged in the project processes, notably the Qaimmaqams (Heads of district/Caza leading the regional security cells), UNHCR and other international agencies regional offices. The project will also collaborate and complement on-going and recent UN initiatives in the targeted areas dealing with issues related to Syrian refugees.


The project will set up a model whereby unions of municipalities, municipalities, and communities are actively and constantly engaged in responding to the needs of the Syrian refugees.

The involvement of local actors will prevent possible bottleneck situations in the response, as it will not be limited to agencies already concerned with overstretched capacities.

Following the July 2006 Israeli war, UN-Habitat Lebanon implemented a project titled “Good governance for enhanced post-war reconstruction in South Lebanon” which aimed at enhancing the capacities of affected families and municipalities to better manage the reconstruction process. Within this project, three Regional Technical Offices (RTOs) were established in three targeted Unions of Municipalities (UoMs); Tyre, Bint Jbeil and Jabal Amel. The RTO's engineers and field officers, being part of the local communities, were able, in a short period of time, to mobilize and immediately provide assistance to affected families as well as to concerned municipalities. By assisting the municipalities with rapid technical assessments of the buildings needing reconstruction work, and providing information and guidelines for house owners with ABCs in repair work, the RTOs contributed to a broad and swift rehabilitation process with the local actors at the steering wheel. 


Based on the previous experience UN-Habitat now replicates the RTO model to support the efforts of providing shelter and services for Syrian refugees as well as meeting the needs of the house communities, by enhancing the role of local authorities. In the first pilot phase two RTOs will be established under the mandate of two Unions of Municipalities within the Saida/Zahrani and Chouf districts. After the pilot RTOs are put in place and anticipated system and mechanisms tested, the approach will be applied in more Unions with further geographical outreach. The aim is to establish a model that could work within all Unions of Municipalities in Lebanon, covering more than 800 of the 1000 Municipalities in the country. To ensure that the project is able to rapidly apply the model in new Unions, a second batch of another three Unions of Municipalities is identified. 
This proposed Project, with a focus on enhancing the involvement of municipalities in responding to the needs of Syrian refugees, would i) complement the efforts of the Government, UNHCR, and other UN, national and international agencies, ii) accelerate the assistance process addressed to refugees, and iii) reduce the tension between host communities and refugees.The goal of the project is to respond to the immediate needs of Syrian refugees and host communities in different areas of Lebanon while laying the foundation for medium and long term sustainable solutions. 

In line with the project goal, the proposed action is planned to achieve two main objectives: 
- Accelerate the accommodation process of refugee families through the active involvement of municipalities and unions of municipalities in identifying, assessing and facilitating sound shelter facilities that comply with UNHCR standards and norms. 
- Support host communities through the implementation of sound projects that would respond to community groups needs and would enhance the delivery of basic urban services taking into account the existing and forthcoming numbers of refugees.


The strategy would include the following:
At the national level, UN-Habitat has been coordinating and will continue collaboration with UNHCR, the Ministry of Social Affairs (MoSA), the Ministry of Interior and Municipalities (MoIM) and other concerned governmental institutions and International agencies. This is being done through taking part in donor meetings as well as working groups, mainly shelter and WASH, and inter-agency meetings.
At the regional levels, in addition to municipalities and unions of municipalities, bureaus and representatives of government and international and UN agencies would constantly be engaged in the project processes, notably the Qaimmaqams (Heads of district/Caza leading the regional security cells), UNHCR and other international agencies regional offices. The project will also collaborate and complement on-going and recent UN initiatives in the targeted areas dealing with issues related to Syrian refugees.


The project will set up a model whereby unions of municipalities, municipalities, and communities are actively and constantly engaged in responding to the needs of the Syrian refugees. Partnerships with key local actors represent a core value for this project. The involvement of local actors will prevent possible bottleneck situations in the response, as it will not be limited to agencies already concerned with overstretched capacities.

Solving this problem is a priority for two reasons. The first is the high numbers of refugees
that have arrived in Jordan, all of whom need somewhere to stay. It is unlikely that there will be a swift
solution to the Syrian crisis, and it is anticipated that Syrian refugees are
likely to stay in in Jordan for at least the next 5-10 years. A solution that providesadequate housing
at scale is crucial for refugees and vulnerable Jordanian families, both of
whom have an urgent need for adequatehousing now and in the coming
years.

The second reason is that low and middle income Jordanian families are
finding housing options are limited for them as well. There is a strong demand for adequatq housing
for young Jordanians so that they can start families of their own, but supply
is becoming increasingly scarce as demand has risen substantially.

The solution contained in this programme will address both elements of
this immediate problem. Jordanians, who
have the right to buy and own land and property, will contribute with their own
down payments and borrowed funds, utilizing their individual credit capacities,
and will be responsible for on-going rental collection and mortgage
repayment. Although smaller than current
housing average size, these units are designed to be combined or expanded once
the mortgage is fully repaid. Syrian and
other refugees and low income Jordanians will have immediate access to rental
housing at affordable rates.The proposal is to
construct smaller 60-67 sqm affordable housing units, which will be designed to
be convertible at a later stage to larger 120-135 sqm units (in line with
existing market expectations), for rental to Jordanian or Syrian families in
the near term. The units will conform to all existing regulation and
legislation regarding the design and construction of houses. Apartment units will also be eligible,
provided they meet the other requirements of the programme. Units may be
constructed individually on an owner's existing land, as well as on a larger
scale by developers, potentially in mixed use developments, on land tracts
contributed by government with an associated cost of no more than 20% of the
overall build cost for each affordable unit. In mixed use situations, cross
subsidies may be applied to manage this land cost level (and potentially the
overall affordable unit cost). As initially
contemplated, the owner/purchaser of these newly constructed units will obtain
10 year financing, for up to 80% of the purchase cost, from banks at market
rates. Purchase cost is expected to be
JD 12,000 per unit (~$15,000). A minimum
20% cash deposit will be mandatory (less than the normal requirement needed, in
order to allow the participation of a greater number of Jordanian households).
If the owner chooses to install a refugee family or a vulnerable Jordanian
family in the unit, the bank lending to the affordable unit purchaser may
receive an interest rate subsidy (equal to the difference between the market
rate and a rate at which the loan repayment is equivalent to an affordable
rent) [direct from government][direct from donors/government] with respect to
the loan in question. Depending on final
determinations of construction costs, affordability and local bank capacity,
other financial subsidies may be applied, some of which are discussed below.
The individual owner will undertake usual landlord roles to ensure that the
property is maintained and the tenant pays rent on time, in order that the
owner's loan at the bank remains current through the combined receipt of the
rent collection and the interest subsidy. The programme objective is to
construct 30,000 new units over 3 years that will be privately financed, yet available
at affordable rent levels for refugee or vulnerable Jordanian family housing.The primary stakeholders of this programme are Jordanian families (as
landlords), refugees and vulnerable Jordanian families (as tenants).The Jordanian families will be owners and landlords of the small rental
properties, providing either their own land for construction, or purchasing
land to construct up to two units or buying from a developer up to two
completed units of housing. They will
manage the rental property (undertaking maintenance and rent collection) and
will apply the rental income to debt service.
Small and mid-sized developers and construction firms will be encouraged
to participate in the programme.Refugees and vulnerable Jordanian families in need of low cost rental
housing will be tenants of the housing units, paying rent at an affordable
level linked to the owner's mortgage repayment amount.Local banks and financial institutions will provide mortgage financing
for up to ten years, potentially complemented by subsidy or guarantee elements
provided (by donors or government) that will reduce interest rates or improve loan
to value ratios, in order to provide opportunity to lower and middle income
Jordanians to participate who might not otherwise be able to finance an
additional housing unit.The Government of Jordan and donors will also be stakeholders. They may
provide a subsidy or or other incentive to increase the supply of adequate housing. If resources are sufficient, these
stakeholders may also provide an additional subsidy to the Jordanian owners as
inducement to house a refugee or vulnerable family, for example in the form of
a conditional partial loan paydown after an agreed length of tenancy. The role of the UN and GoJ will be to provide
oversight to ensure that the subsidies are applied effectively in order that
these vulnerable target communities benefit from the stable, affordable rental
housing provided.The Housing and
Urban Development Corporation within the Ministry of Public Works and Housing
(MoPWH) will be an important Government counterpart as the lead Government
institution responsible for housing.
HUDC's mandate is to develop comprehensive housing policies; activate
public-private partnerships; and enable limited income groups to access
adequate housing. HUDC, through the
process of developing the National Resilience Plan (NRP) indicated its
intention to update the national housing policy, which was originally developed
in 1992. This project will work closely
with HUDC to develop a broad study of the housing market that will feed into
HUDC's broader policy reform agenda.
This, combined with the additional detailed studies to be undertaken
during the project, will provide valuable evidence to support policy
reforms.The Ministry for
Municipal Affairs (MoMA) also plays an important role in housing supply. It includes an Urban Planning Department that
designs and approves land-use plans for all municipalities with the exception
of the largest ones (such as Amman and Aqaba). They play an important role in
ensuring that humanitarian and popular responses to the refugee crisis do not
exacerbate urban sprawl, which is 7 times more expensive to service than more
compact models of development. The
Programme will provide housing construction incentives for development to occur
in more compact and sustainable forms.Broader
stakeholder consultations have confirmed that there is significant interest in
the initiative. The Municipalities of
Sahel Horan, Serhan and Ramtha (all heavily impacted by the refugee crisis)
have identified municipal land close to the city centres that they wish to
develop for housing. They have requested
UN-Habitat support, however, to: (i) improve the building designs and layout;
(ii) structure the financing; (iii) review various management options (eg.
rental housing) that would provide them with a sustainable revenue stream. Thus, the project will also help reduce the
deficits that plague many Jordanian municipalities. UN-Habitat has just started a municipal
creditworthiness programme to help improve municipal finances and these two
programmes will complement each other.Positive meetings
have also been held with the Central Bank, commercial banks and
developers. The Central Bank confirmed
that commercial banks have significant capacity to increase term lending for
housing within their loan portfolios.
Commercial banks have indicated their interest in developing new loan
products for this market segment, but are not yet sure how to engage with this
new group of “clients”. Commercial banks
in Jordan have, in aggregate, the needed term funding to meet the anticipated
financing needs of this $450 million programme.
Developers have confirmed the feasibility of designing a house to the
specifications provided and at the price indicated (JD12,000 or $15,000). A Jordanian institute has expressed its
interest to sponsor a national design competition to promote more compact,
affordable and livable urban housing.Additional
stakeholders may also include humanitarian NGOs. NRC and Première Urgence, for example, have
approached UN-Habitat to identify how its emergency shelter grant may be
complemented by an affordable housing loan.
Similar consultations will also be held with other NGOs which have
already secured grant funding for housing rehabilitation. In both cases, the limited scale and focus of
humanitarian funding can be complemented by more development oriented
funding. By combining humanitarian and
development funding, this programme will achieve outcomes more in line with the
right to “adequate housing”.UN-Habitat is providing knowledge services in terms of programme
delivery and the leveraging and alignment of government support. It is also providing advisory services. Specialized financial services will be
provided for financial structuring, negotiation and delivery through UN-Habitat
consultants.",2,2014-09-18,2016-02-29,,,,,,,Denmark,,,,,,,,,,,,JO,Jordan,100,589,"Middle East, regional",,73010,Reconstruction relief and rehabilitation,,OECD Development Assistance Committee,DAC,1,110,20,CO1,CO1

overall affordable unit cost). As initially
contemplated, the owner/purchaser of these newly constructed units will obtain
10 year financing, for up to 80% of the purchase cost, from banks at market
rates. Purchase cost is expected to be
JD 12,000 per unit (~$15,000). A minimum
20% cash deposit will be mandatory (less than the normal requirement needed, in
order to allow the participation of a greater number of Jordanian households).
If the owner chooses to install a refugee family or a vulnerable Jordanian
family in the unit, the bank lending to the affordable unit purchaser may
receive an interest rate subsidy (equal to the difference between the market
rate and a rate at which the loan repayment is equivalent to an affordable
rent) [direct from government][direct from donors/government] with respect to
the loan in question. Depending on final
determinations of construction costs, affordability and local bank capacity,
other financial subsidies may be applied, some of which are discussed below.
The individual owner will undertake usual landlord roles to ensure that the
property is maintained and the tenant pays rent on time, in order that the
owner's loan at the bank remains current through the combined receipt of the
rent collection and the interest subsidy. The programme objective is to
construct 30,000 new units over 3 years that will be privately financed, yet available
at affordable rent levels for refugee or vulnerable Jordanian family housing.The primary stakeholders of this programme are Jordanian families (as
landlords), refugees and vulnerable Jordanian families (as tenants).The Jordanian families will be owners and landlords of the small rental
properties, providing either their own land for construction, or purchasing
land to construct up to two units or buying from a developer up to two
completed units of housing. They will
manage the rental property (undertaking maintenance and rent collection) and
will apply the rental income to debt service.
Small and mid-sized developers and construction firms will be encouraged
to participate in the programme.Refugees and vulnerable Jordanian families in need of low cost rental
housing will be tenants of the housing units, paying rent at an affordable
level linked to the owner's mortgage repayment amount.Local banks and financial institutions will provide mortgage financing
for up to ten years, potentially complemented by subsidy or guarantee elements
provided (by donors or government) that will reduce interest rates or improve loan
to value ratios, in order to provide opportunity to lower and middle income
Jordanians to participate who might not otherwise be able to finance an
additional housing unit.The Government of Jordan and donors will also be stakeholders. They may
provide a subsidy or or other incentive to increase the supply of adequate housing. If resources are sufficient, these
stakeholders may also provide an additional subsidy to the Jordanian owners as
inducement to house a refugee or vulnerable family, for example in the form of
a conditional partial loan paydown after an agreed length of tenancy. The role of the UN and GoJ will be to provide
oversight to ensure that the subsidies are applied effectively in order that
these vulnerable target communities benefit from the stable, affordable rental
housing provided.The Housing and
Urban Development Corporation within the Ministry of Public Works and Housing
(MoPWH) will be an important Government counterpart as the lead Government
institution responsible for housing.
HUDC's mandate is to develop comprehensive housing policies; activate
public-private partnerships; and enable limited income groups to access
adequate housing. HUDC, through the
process of developing the National Resilience Plan (NRP) indicated its
intention to update the national housing policy, which was originally developed
in 1992. This project will work closely
with HUDC to develop a broad study of the housing market that will feed into
HUDC's broader policy reform agenda.
This, combined with the additional detailed studies to be undertaken
during the project, will provide valuable evidence to support policy
reforms.The Ministry for
Municipal Affairs (MoMA) also plays an important role in housing supply. It includes an Urban Planning Department that
designs and approves land-use plans for all municipalities with the exception
of the largest ones (such as Amman and Aqaba). They play an important role in
ensuring that humanitarian and popular responses to the refugee crisis do not
exacerbate urban sprawl, which is 7 times more expensive to service than more
compact models of development. The
Programme will provide housing construction incentives for development to occur
in more compact and sustainable forms.Broader
stakeholder consultations have confirmed that there is significant interest in
the initiative. The Municipalities of
Sahel Horan, Serhan and Ramtha (all heavily impacted by the refugee crisis)
have identified municipal land close to the city centres that they wish to
develop for housing. They have requested
UN-Habitat support, however, to: (i) improve the building designs and layout;
(ii) structure the financing; (iii) review various management options (eg.
rental housing) that would provide them with a sustainable revenue stream. Thus, the project will also help reduce the
deficits that plague many Jordanian municipalities. UN-Habitat has just started a municipal
creditworthiness programme to help improve municipal finances and these two
programmes will complement each other.Positive meetings
have also been held with the Central Bank, commercial banks and
developers. The Central Bank confirmed
that commercial banks have significant capacity to increase term lending for
housing within their loan portfolios.
Commercial banks have indicated their interest in developing new loan
products for this market segment, but are not yet sure how to engage with this
new group of “clients”. Commercial banks
in Jordan have, in aggregate, the needed term funding to meet the anticipated
financing needs of this $450 million programme.
Developers have confirmed the feasibility of designing a house to the
specifications provided and at the price indicated (JD12,000 or $15,000). A Jordanian institute has expressed its
interest to sponsor a national design competition to promote more compact,
affordable and livable urban housing.Additional
stakeholders may also include humanitarian NGOs. NRC and Première Urgence, for example, have
approached UN-Habitat to identify how its emergency shelter grant may be
complemented by an affordable housing loan.
Similar consultations will also be held with other NGOs which have
already secured grant funding for housing rehabilitation. In both cases, the limited scale and focus of
humanitarian funding can be complemented by more development oriented
funding. By combining humanitarian and
development funding, this programme will achieve outcomes more in line with the
right to “adequate housing”.UN-Habitat is providing knowledge services in terms of programme
delivery and the leveraging and alignment of government support. It is also providing advisory services. Specialized financial services will be
provided for financial structuring, negotiation and delivery through UN-Habitat

the key step for reasserting urban space and territoriality and for providing
the needed direction and course of action to support urban development. The
national urban policy provides an overarching coordinating framework to address
the most pressing issues related to rapid urban development, including slum
prevention and regularization, access to land, basic services and infrastructure,
urban legislation, delegation of authority to subnational and local
governments, financial flows, urban planning regulations, urban mobility and
urban energy requirements, as well as job creation.

from sustainable urban development, as well as an opportunity to promote

By 2050, about 70 per cent of the world's population
is projected to live in urban areas. Rapid urban growth is mainly occurring in
developing countries with their specific governments unable to provide needed
amenities by the urban population. The informal settlements in most cities of
the world provide habitat to 33 per cent of the urban population. If left
unaddressed, these trends may become sources of social and political
instability.

The
purpose of this project is to advocate for a new global approach towards urban
development especially in developing countries. The project road map identifies
key activities that would facilitate the building of capacities of relevant
stakeholders for their substantive negotiations towards defining the global
urban agenda and participation at global milestones. Capacities of all relevant
stake holders must be harnessed to advocate for adequate policy tools,

the realization of establishing sustainable towns and cities that are greener,

active in international fora since the adoption in 1988 of the Global Strategy
for Shelter to the Year 2000 by the General Assembly of the United Nations. The
main steps were the following:1989: Adoption of the National Housing Strategy that covered all
housing components and produced a set of recommendations that governed the
Jordanian housing sector's activities for 20 years.1992: Merging of former Housing Corporation and Urban
Development Department to form the HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION
(HUDC) to become the official umbrella for the housing sector. HUDC was
mandated to work in two areas: housing production and housing policies. 1996: Launching of the Housing Reform Project that addressed the
major issues of the housing sector. The main accomplishments of the reform
were: 










 
  establishment of Jordan Mortgage
      Refinance Company
  granting the private sector rights to
      use standards (plot sizes) developed by HUDC
  launching partnership with the private
      sector, 
  changing zoning criteria : re-zoning and
      down zoning for smaller plots
  cancellation of the Housing Bank law to
      encourages banking competition in housing finance
  rationalizing of housing subsidies.TheHUDC's mandate is to develop comprehensive housing policies; activate
public-private partnerships; and enable limited income groups to access

in collaboration with MOMA (UPD) and municipalities, for selected urban areas.
This task should be financed by the clients/beneficiaries. It will entail:

development;. liaising with UPD to review their macro-zoning plans;. preparing action plans (trunk infrastructure development) for priority
areas.
 

 
Solving this problem is a priority for two reasons. The first is the high numbers of refugees
that have arrived in Jordan, all of whom need somewhere to stay. It is unlikely that there will be a swift
solution to the Syrian crisis, and it is anticipated that Syrian refugees are
likely to stay in in Jordan for at least the next 5-10 years. A solution that providesadequate housing
at scale is crucial for refugees and vulnerable Jordanian families, both of
whom have an urgent need for adequatehousing now and in the coming
years.

The second reason is that low and middle income Jordanian families are
finding housing options are limited for them as well. There is a strong demand for adequatq housing
for young Jordanians so that they can start families of their own, but supply
is becoming increasingly scarce as demand has risen substantially.

The solution contained in this programme will address both elements of
this immediate problem. Jordanians, who
have the right to buy and own land and property, will contribute with their own
down payments and borrowed funds, utilizing their individual credit capacities,
and will be responsible for on-going rental collection and mortgage
repayment. Although smaller than current
housing average size, these units are designed to be combined or expanded once
the mortgage is fully repaid. Syrian and
other refugees and low income Jordanians will have immediate access to rental
housing at affordable rates.The proposal is to
construct smaller 60-67 sqm affordable housing units, which will be designed to
be convertible at a later stage to larger 120-135 sqm units (in line with
existing market expectations), for rental to Jordanian or Syrian families in
the near term. The units will conform to all existing regulation and
legislation regarding the design and construction of houses. Apartment units will also be eligible,
provided they meet the other requirements of the programme. Units may be
constructed individually on an owner's existing land, as well as on a larger
scale by developers, potentially in mixed use developments, on land tracts
contributed by government with an associated cost of no more than 20% of the
overall build cost for each affordable unit. In mixed use situations, cross
subsidies may be applied to manage this land cost level (and potentially the
overall affordable unit cost). As initially
contemplated, the owner/purchaser of these newly constructed units will obtain
10 year financing, for up to 80% of the purchase cost, from banks at market
rates. Purchase cost is expected to be
JD 12,000 per unit (~$15,000). A minimum
20% cash deposit will be mandatory (less than the normal requirement needed, in
order to allow the participation of a greater number of Jordanian households).
If the owner chooses to install a refugee family or a vulnerable Jordanian
family in the unit, the bank lending to the affordable unit purchaser may
receive an interest rate subsidy (equal to the difference between the market
rate and a rate at which the loan repayment is equivalent to an affordable
rent) [direct from government][direct from donors/government] with respect to
the loan in question. Depending on final
determinations of construction costs, affordability and local bank capacity,
other financial subsidies may be applied, some of which are discussed below.
The individual owner will undertake usual landlord roles to ensure that the
property is maintained and the tenant pays rent on time, in order that the
owner's loan at the bank remains current through the combined receipt of the
rent collection and the interest subsidy. The programme objective is to
construct 30,000 new units over 3 years that will be privately financed, yet available
at affordable rent levels for refugee or vulnerable Jordanian family housing.The primary stakeholders of this programme are Jordanian families (as
landlords), refugees and vulnerable Jordanian families (as tenants).The Jordanian families will be owners and landlords of the small rental
properties, providing either their own land for construction, or purchasing
land to construct up to two units or buying from a developer up to two
completed units of housing. They will
manage the rental property (undertaking maintenance and rent collection) and
will apply the rental income to debt service.
Small and mid-sized developers and construction firms will be encouraged
to participate in the programme.Refugees and vulnerable Jordanian families in need of low cost rental
housing will be tenants of the housing units, paying rent at an affordable
level linked to the owner's mortgage repayment amount.Local banks and financial institutions will provide mortgage financing
for up to ten years, potentially complemented by subsidy or guarantee elements
provided (by donors or government) that will reduce interest rates or improve loan
to value ratios, in order to provide opportunity to lower and middle income
Jordanians to participate who might not otherwise be able to finance an
additional housing unit.The Government of Jordan and donors will also be stakeholders. They may
provide a subsidy or or other incentive to increase the supply of adequate housing. If resources are sufficient, these
stakeholders may also provide an additional subsidy to the Jordanian owners as
inducement to house a refugee or vulnerable family, for example in the form of
a conditional partial loan paydown after an agreed length of tenancy. The role of the UN and GoJ will be to provide
oversight to ensure that the subsidies are applied effectively in order that
these vulnerable target communities benefit from the stable, affordable rental
housing provided.The Housing and
Urban Development Corporation within the Ministry of Public Works and Housing
(MoPWH) will be an important Government counterpart as the lead Government
institution responsible for housing.
HUDC's mandate is to develop comprehensive housing policies; activate
public-private partnerships; and enable limited income groups to access
adequate housing. HUDC, through the
process of developing the National Resilience Plan (NRP) indicated its
intention to update the national housing policy, which was originally developed
in 1992. This project will work closely
with HUDC to develop a broad study of the housing market that will feed into
HUDC's broader policy reform agenda.
This, combined with the additional detailed studies to be undertaken
during the project, will provide valuable evidence to support policy
reforms.The Ministry for
Municipal Affairs (MoMA) also plays an important role in housing supply. It includes an Urban Planning Department that
designs and approves land-use plans for all municipalities with the exception
of the largest ones (such as Amman and Aqaba). They play an important role in
ensuring that humanitarian and popular responses to the refugee crisis do not
exacerbate urban sprawl, which is 7 times more expensive to service than more
compact models of development. The
Programme will provide housing construction incentives for development to occur
in more compact and sustainable forms.Broader
stakeholder consultations have confirmed that there is significant interest in
the initiative. The Municipalities of
Sahel Horan, Serhan and Ramtha (all heavily impacted by the refugee crisis)
have identified municipal land close to the city centres that they wish to
develop for housing. They have requested
UN-Habitat support, however, to: (i) improve the building designs and layout;
(ii) structure the financing; (iii) review various management options (eg.
rental housing) that would provide them with a sustainable revenue stream. Thus, the project will also help reduce the
deficits that plague many Jordanian municipalities. UN-Habitat has just started a municipal
creditworthiness programme to help improve municipal finances and these two
programmes will complement each other.Positive meetings
have also been held with the Central Bank, commercial banks and
developers. The Central Bank confirmed
that commercial banks have significant capacity to increase term lending for
housing within their loan portfolios.
Commercial banks have indicated their interest in developing new loan
products for this market segment, but are not yet sure how to engage with this
new group of “clients”. Commercial banks
in Jordan have, in aggregate, the needed term funding to meet the anticipated
financing needs of this $450 million programme.
Developers have confirmed the feasibility of designing a house to the
specifications provided and at the price indicated (JD12,000 or $15,000). A Jordanian institute has expressed its
interest to sponsor a national design competition to promote more compact,
affordable and livable urban housing.Additional
stakeholders may also include humanitarian NGOs. NRC and Première Urgence, for example, have
approached UN-Habitat to identify how its emergency shelter grant may be
complemented by an affordable housing loan.
Similar consultations will also be held with other NGOs which have
already secured grant funding for housing rehabilitation. In both cases, the limited scale and focus of
humanitarian funding can be complemented by more development oriented
funding. By combining humanitarian and
development funding, this programme will achieve outcomes more in line with the
right to “adequate housing”.UN-Habitat is providing knowledge services in terms of programme
delivery and the leveraging and alignment of government support. It is also providing advisory services. Specialized financial services will be
provided for financial structuring, negotiation and delivery through UN-Habitat

In addition, working towards achievements of the MDGs will be at the core of ERSO activities (GC 21//10, paragraph 7). The purpose of the ERSO programme is to:Field-test experimental and
reimbursable seeding operations and other innovative operations for financing
the urban poor housing, infrastructure development and upgrading through
community groups, including where there is an expectation of repayments
mobilizing capital at the local level; 

Strengthen the capacity of local financial and development actors to carry out
those operations and to support the capacity of the United Nations Human
Settlements Programme to enhance those operations

become a self-sustaining revolving loan fund which will balance three 
types of lending to expand housing finance markets globally: Construction
 of new affordable housing units (reaching low-income salaried workers 
such as teachers, nurses, police and government workers, industrial 
sector workers), particularly in regions where there is a severe 
shortage of affordable housing stock; Lead investments in 
microfinance/infrastructure/microfinance housing loan institution 
initiatives to create secondary finance programmes and access capital 
markets, and; Very low-cost loans to allow early stage microfinance housing programs to grow to sustainable size. The revolving loan fund is a highly effective tool to reach underserved populations from the 30th down to the 85th

Emerging from the 1990s some organizations and individuals have been trying to address this issue, but have struggled with the scale of the challenge geographically and conceptually. In essence, most developing countries use conventional land administration systems which cover less than 30 percent of the country, leaving up to 70 percent of citizens looking to informal and/or customary approaches for their tenure security.An extensive gap analysis was conducted which drew several important conclusions. First, while there are many examples of good land policies, there are few policies that have been fully implemented due to lack of pro-poor, gender-sensitive and large-scale land tools. Second, a conclusion was that conventional land titling approaches have largely failed to deliver their expectedresults: existing technical solutions are too expensive, inappropriate for the range of tenure found in developing countries, unsustainable financially or in terms of available capacity, and instead a range of land tenure options is more appropriate. Third, an agreement was that land sector work in countrycannot be done at scale successfully in many countries without the combination of various underlying factors and strategies including better donor coordination, strengthening partnerships of key land actors, capacity development initiatives and continuous dialogues and communicationsbetween and amongst key stakeholders including government (at various levels), professionals, civil society groups, academia/research institutions, grassroots and target communities themselves.To address these challenges, UN-HABITAT has taken the lead and facilitated the establishment of the Global Land Tool Network (now with 45 international partners) aimed at contributing to poverty reduction and to the achievement of MDGs through the development of pro-poor and gender sensitive land tools to improve tenure security of the urban and rural poor since its launch in 2006.GLTN Phase 1 has already achieved significant results in its 4 years of operations as concluded by the independent mid-term evaluation and echoed by various partners and land actors. For example, there is now a growing paradigm shift towards the adoption of a pro-poor, gender sensitive and largescale land tools, policies and approaches; as well as the recognition of the need for a ‘continuum of land rights’ to replace the more conventional approaches of reliance on cadastre and individual titles. Global discourse on key GLTN’s tools and approaches are well captured by various global and regional interventions. Examples include the following: World Bank is taking the lead in the development of Land Governance and Administration Framework (LGAF) globally; FAO is taking the lead in the development and possible adoption by member-states of the Voluntary Guidelines on Good Governance on Tenure of Land and Natural Resources and recently, wherein UN-HABITAT has played a critical role, the adoption of the African Land Policy Framework and Guidelines which was supported and adopted by recently concluded Third AMCHUD conference and Bamako Action Plan.Moreover, Phase 1 has already developed significant land tools and training packages ready for rolling out with partners at national and local government levels. Some partners are already adopting these land tools for their use and for their capacity development initiatives. For example, the gender evaluation criteria tool has now been adopted by Huairou Commission for their implementation and training for trainers (ToTs) will be conducted before the end of the year. Likewise, the International Land Coalition has indicated that they would like to adopt and implement the same on their countrylevelprojects in various countries. Training for land professionals on this tool has also started. As part of GLTN Phase 2, the gender evaluation criteria will also be introduced and mainstreamed in UN-HABITAT operations particularly in providing in-country support to tool implementation in targeted countries and/or cities/municipalities and the needed capacity building initiatives will beundertaken. The Kenya experience in land policy formulation, donor coordination and engagement with non-state actors has been used as a model for other country’s interventions by UN-HABITAT (e.g. DRC, Eastern Caribbean Island States, South Sudan and Liberia). GLTN partners from theacademia and training institutions are now adopting the land tools developed, concepts and training packages in their training and educational curriculum. For example, ITC-Netherlands is now teaching the concept and use of the Social Tenure Domain Model (STDM) – a pro-poor land rights recording system to their Masters’ Program while the Technical University of Munich has been mobilizing resources to adopt some GLTN training packages for their curriculum as well as for conducting the same training sessions. GLTN’s partnership with grassroots organizations has also yielded some significant successes. Aside from understanding the underlying reasons why goodgrassroots land projects have difficulties in going to scale, specific experiences like that of Brazil resulted in the regularization of an estimated 55,000 slum dwellers.While significant results have been achieved by GLTN Phase 1, a great deal more work is required for gains made to be consolidated and extended. GLTN Phase 2 will further expand its partnership and scope from its known international partners (45) to UN-HABITAT staff and selected landprogrammes/projects. It will also implement some of its priority land tools in targeted countries and/or cities/municipalities in partnership with UN-HABITAT’s field projects and/or international partners with their national and local networks, particularly in regard to the agencies new priorityareas of urban land, legislations and governance. GLTN Phase 2, in close collaboration with RTCD and other partners will ensure that in-country interventions will be within the framework of ‘One UN System’ as delivering as one and in accordance with the country’s Poverty Reduction StrategyPapers (PRSPs) and/or strategic plans. The key objective is to have more change agents and champions that have the capacity and knowledge to promote and implement land policies, tools and approaches that are pro-poor, gender-sensitive, effective and sustainable to improve tenure securityof the urban and rural poor. In this context, there is an urgent need and increasing demand for GLTN to: continue its work; expand its brand and help develop capacities of its partners (internal and external); and support theadoption and implementation of pro-poor and gender appropriate land policies, tools and approaches at national and local government levels through forging strategic partnerships and piloting and working at country level.",2,2012-01-01,2015-12-15,,,,,,,Norway,,,,,,,,Norwegian University of Life Sciences (UMB),,,,WW,,100,998,"Developing countries, unspecified",,,,,,,1,110,20,CO1,CO1

The key objective is to have more change agents and champions that have the capacity and knowledge to promote and implement land policies, tools and approaches that are pro-poor, gender-sensitive, effective and sustainable to improve tenure securityof the urban and rural poor. In this context, there is an urgent need and increasing demand for GLTN to: continue its work; expand its brand and help develop capacities of its partners (internal and external); and support theadoption and implementation of pro-poor and gender appropriate land policies, tools and approaches at national and local government levels through forging strategic partnerships and piloting and working at country level.",2,2012-01-01,2015-12-15,,,,,,,Norway,,,,,,,,Norwegian University of Life Sciences (UMB),,,,WW,,100,998,"Developing countries, unspecified",,,,,,,1,110,20,CO1,CO1

UN-Habitat is the city agency and focal point for local
governments within the UN system. UN-Habitat, and indeed the Habitat Agenda,
have made it quite clear that it is at the local or city level where the Agenda
(and other related international human settlements development goals) must be implemented
and succeed. Since local authorities are the level of governance closest to
people, they play a vital role in educating, mobilizing, and responding to the
public to promote sustainable urbanization. Local authorities are the main
Habitat Agenda Partner. Local authorities consist of the group that include
mayors, municipal councils, and other decision-makers who are involved in
constructing, operating and maintaining economic, social and environmental
infrastructure; who oversee planning processes, establish local policies and
regulations, and assist in implementing national and sub-national policies. Through
UNACLA, UN-Habitat has an effective and strategic way for collaborating with,
and obtaining inputs of, a well-organized and geographically represented group
of local authorities. UNACLA is also one of the channels by which to build on
cooperation with local authority associations and, as a result, complement
parallel activities within country-level technical cooperation.

The global and regional engagement of local
authorities is important to the success of UN-Habitat's overall partnership
approaches and strategy. Global and regional approaches consist of normative,
advocacy, and knowledge management activities. UNACLA can be a means by which
the broader network of local authorities can participate in the meetings of
regional ministerial conferences supported by UN-Habitat, which allow for
normative debate on key issues brought forward by national governments and UN-Habitat
working within the Enhanced Normative and Operational Framework (ENOF) and are
informed by major UN-Habitat analytical publications such as the “Global Report
on Human Settlements” and the “State of the Cities” reports. 



UN-Habitat has established information activities at
the national and global levels as a way to ensure that the concerns and
priorities of the human settlements sector are mainstreamed into national
policies and programmes. This is done especially through the over 40 UNDP
country offices where Habitat Programme Managers (HPMs) are located. UNACLA can
provide strategic inputs to these important UN-Habitat processes, by providing
the local government and local governance dimensions to emerging issues being
promoted by UN-Habitat.



As for the planning and preparations for the Habitat
III conference in 2016, the focus must be on building partnerships and on the
commitments UN-Habitat as well as Governments, local authorities and all other
partner groups will make towards achieving sustainable urbanization and shelter
for all. UNACLA, together with the World Urban Campaign, the World Urban Forum,
the Partners Platform, National Habitat Committees and other supporting
clusters of partner organizations, will have to be utilized to mobilize support
for Habitat III at the global, national and local levels and to activate
preparatory committees for Habitat III.

Initiatives focused in these areas comprise the underlying purpose of I-PSM Phase II. 

The programme seeks to strengthen the regulatory and institutional framework and processes of national and local governance to enhance service delivery. 
Particular focus will ensure that sector service delivery efforts and corresponding human rights are universal where they can be (health, education and water supply and sanitation) and targeted to the poorest of the poor wherever possible. The programme adopts participatory approaches and aims to re-train and restructure ministries and governorate offices, Iraqi citizens will have a clear understanding of the structures and processes in government, its decision-making, and how they can participate in these processes. 

I-PSM Phase II responds to the findings, lessons learned and recommendations of Phase I. The programme is designed with a holistic approach to governance reforms, capacity development and sector modernisation.
The proposed intervention addresses the need of carrying out a long term, comprehensive and whole of government reforms at national and sub national levels focused on improving service delivery to the citizens in the three sectors of education, health and WATSAN. In Phase I (2010-2012), functional reviews of these sectors were carried out jointly by the concerned Ministries of GoI and UN agencies. UN agencies provided technical assistance in preparing the road map and costed service delivery models of the three sectors. Phase II will support the GoI in implementing the roadmaps prepared in Phase I. Besides the reform initiatives planned for the whole of the government in Iraq, KRG has agreed to undertake a comprehensive civil service reforms for the Region.

The Programme has four themes: i) Developing institutional arrangements and the distribution of roles, authority and decision-making mechanisms; ii) Piloting reform in three key sectors: health; education; and water and sanitation (WATSAN), focusing on (1) modern  institutional arrangements (with requisite laws, legislations, regulations and plans, policies and strategies( (2) Public Private Partnership (3) Cost-effective fiscal management and (4) Modern human resources management methods; iii) Supporting system-wide reform for gender mainstreaming, e-governance, national statistics and development management; and iv) Supporting decentralised service delivery and local governance initiatives, particularly focusing on development of tools for social participation.

UN-Habitat's expertise and background in service delivery, particularly in the field of water and sanitation, its ongoing relationship with the MMPW, and its knowledge of effective modes of decentralization are key reasons for UN-Habitat's participation in the overall programme.  UN-Habitat will focus on programme outputs relating to assisting the GoI in developing reform and modernization plans for the Water and Sanitation Sector, as well as improving decentralized service delivery in target sectors – with enhanced local governance and participation.  

UN-Habitat in partnership with UNICEF will support reforms to water and sanitation sector through implementation of sector specific modernisation plans and capacity development programmes, as per the agreed roadmaps of I-PSM Phase I by the relevant line ministries, and in the KRG (upstream and downstream reform). This intervention aims directly at improving service quality through development of service delivery models, developing operational arrangements for utility, focusing on rationalized use and use practices as well as developing a medium-term fiscal framework to be a link between the policy making process, priorities and budget. 
Furthermore, UN-Habitat in partnership with the other UN agencies will provide support to strengthen the local governance institutions at the provincial and city-level, promote participatory processes, improve urban governance and support decentralised service delivery, including fiscal decentralisation (downstream reform).

So far, implementation of the DDPD has been slower and less complete than envisaged, placing strain on the mechanisms of the agreement. For example, the absence of local social services despite best efforts continues to be a challenge and is increasing frustrations. Even so, the framework created by the DDP provides a unique window of opportunity to engage in ‘business unusual'.
Efforts have been made to settle conflicts arising from transhumance routes. In 1989 in North Darfur the governor together with local councils and the Native Administration reached an agreement on the rules governing transhumance routes. The North Darfur State Transhumance Act in 1991 enshrined these principles. The Act has been followed by many conferences and workshops, but has remained ineffective due to inadequate involvement by the pastorals and farmers, and the weakness of the Native Administration. A national high committee on transhumance was established by the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources in 1997 to prepare a comprehensive study of livestock corridors, where a Livestock Corridors Act was promulgated by the governor in 1998. The Act defines livestock routes, different categories of pasture and water points, lists activities not allowed on stock routes including farming, burning, cutting of trees, building and harvesting of fodder, and fixes penalties. A conflict resolution committee is created with membership from the administration including the police, and the native administration. There are no herder or farmer representatives. The general opinion is that the lack of real contact with the grass roots makes this committee ineffective. Transhumance routes remain a key issue for the project. 
Useful lessons learned through implementation of Sudan Peace Building and Development Project SPDP have been taken into consideration when designing this Project Proposal, which aims to make contributions towards the following areas:
Better management of natural resources, within and between local communities, and between communities and the state

The NSP aims to empower Afghans to build solidarity, reduce poverty through establishing and strengthening a national network of self-governing community institutions. The flexible and responsive design of the NSP has allowed it to be a main conduit of central government's poverty reduction and reconstruction policies, enabling local people to actively participate in local governance and development through the formation of CDCs. As a result, rural people of Afghanistan are able to build on a shared vision, and values, and democratically-decided priorities to create a healthy and sustainable nation. 

NSP fosters public trust in governance, enhances unity, equity and justice with communities democratically electing their own councils to engage in important local decisions and deciding how to distribute resources to address their development priorities. 

The concept of the NSP is based on the provision of block grants directly provided by the government to communities for rural infrastructure projects. Each community elects their representatives to form the CDC, the main decision-making body at the local level. In order to avoid a situation where candidates get threatened or run for the competition out of fear of local power holders, the elections follow a “no-candidate” rule. They would be valid only if at least 60% of the community members participate in elections, thus requiring the participation of women. The CDC is the main interlocutor of the government and other development actors. It designates members who are responsible for financial management, including opening of a bank account in the name of the community. In addition, the CDC can establish specific sub-committees responsible for procurement, implementation and maintenance, and monitoring and evaluation.

The NSP consists of four core elements:

· Facilitation at the community level to assist communities to further strengthen inclusive CDCs through secret ballot and democratic (re)elections; reach consensus on priorities and corresponding subproject activities; develop eligible subproject proposals that comply with NSP appraisal criteria; and implement approved subprojects;
· Building capacity of CDCs and community members (both men and women) in participation, consensus-building, accounting, procurement and contract management, operations and maintenance, and monitoring;
· Providing direct block grant transfers to fund approved subprojects; and
· Linking CDCs to government agencies, NGOs, and donors to improve access to services and resources.


Target Groups: The primary beneficiaries are the villagers (both men and women), including the poor and the vulnerable groups, who through a participatory planning process, select sub-projects that addresses their needs for local reconstruction and development. Empowerment of rural population is achieved through participatory planning, local reconstruction and development leading to improved livelihoods and access to services benefiting both men and women.

Based on the principles of inclusion and equity, NSP ensures inclusion of women and vulnerable groups (such as ethnic/tribal minority groups, elderly, IDPs, returnees, refugees) to ensure that these groups are included in decision-making processes and that their concerns are fully addressed.

A total of 956 communities of twelve districts in seven provinces, as given in Table below, will benefit from empowerment through participating in CDC activities and access to improved infrastructure and services.

This will promote sustainable housing system to contribute to address the two major global challenges - climate change mitigation and poverty reduction. The green initiative will mainly work in urban areas, with SMEs related to housing that will help to reduce GHG emission and other pollutants, enhancing resource efficiency through supporting market forces (i.e. producers, consumers and enablers including the government). The initiative intends to bring in state-of-art knowledge and skills from European countries and expects to promulgate the good practices in the region through networks of SWITCH Asia, IHS/Erasmus University, UN-Habitat and others. 

The project will address three aspects:
i) Creating enabling policy environment to promote sustainable housing 
ii) Strengthening supply chains for sustainable housing and building capacity of SMEs to deliver household level green technologies and services. 
iii) Stimulating consumer demand for sustainable housing;

In recent years, some SMEs have started to produce green products and services that are related to sustainable housing. Few SMEs like solar energy companies are trying to exploit the market prompted by the on-going energy crisis, while others have started producing and marketing products and services such as eco-housing, rain water harvesting, waste and wastewater recycling, hollow concrete blocks, soil cement blocks and passive energy design. However, these industries are still in their infancy and there are three major gaps in promoting sustainable housing - a) need to create an enabling environment by developing supportive policy frameworks and incentives for the SMEs and consumers, b) need to strengthen the supply chain of the SMEs to ensure smooth supply of quality products at a competitive price, and c) social marketing campaign to increase consumer education on availability of the products and services and their importance. Moreover, skilled human resource is yet other hurdles to flourish this emerging business. 
As sustainable housing involves large number of stakeholders, there is a need to bring together different stakeholders for this common cause. This project will bring together Nepalese SMEs and their associations as intermediary organizations, government agencies such as Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD) and Department of Urban Development and Building Construction (DUDBC), municipalities, NGOs involved in the sector and financing institutions such as Town Development Fund. NGOs, such as Clean Energy Nepal (CEN), Environment and Public Health Organization (ENPHO) and Shelter and Local Technology Development Centre (SLTDC), which have experience in research and promotion of energy efficient building, water and waste management, can play an important role in building local capacity. Similarly, Intermediary organisations such as associations of SMEs including Federation of Nepalese Chamber of Commerce and Industries (FNCCI) and Nepal Land and Housing Development Association (NLHDA) can play an important role in mobilizing SMEs. Institute for Housing and Urban Development Studies (IHS), Netherlands, a world leader in research and training related to sustainable housing, will provide its technical expertise and also assist in improving existing local technologies and innovations, as well as in learning from the European experience in this sector. UN-Habitat is therefore partnering with all these institutions to put forth a strong and multi-disciplinary team to implement this project. UN-Habitat will also utilize its own in-house expertise and experiences from projects such as “Promoting Energy Efficiency in Buildings in Africa” which it is implementing in five countries in Sub-Saharan Africa with support from Global Environment Facility (GEF). Limited market is the main barrier to sustainable housing contributed by lack of product information to consumers, skilled human resource and conducive policy environment. Therefore there is a need of easing the supply chain. As several of the conventional housing products are imported limited jobs are created locally, providing less economic opportunities to the poor. The sector workers need skill training for quality service and better link to specialized job market. Similarly, practicing architects/engineers can compete in the market by providing energy efficient and cost effective sustainable housing solutions to their clients. Information gap on available green products and services make them compromise on conventional products. The government offices are overburdened by their daily rituals and need support to upscale the sector. From the beneficiary side, there is huge gap on understanding the importance of green products and services.

UN-Habitat Cities Prosperity Initiative is a strategic policy initiative for
cities and partners that are committed to aligning their policies, operations
and strategies with UN-Habitat's fresh notion of prosperity. Cities are expected to work simultaneously in
the five dimensions of prosperity: productivity, infrastructure, quality of
life, equity and environmental sustainability.




The City Prosperity Initiative is a practical
framework for the formulation, implementation, and monitoring of sustainability
policies and practices to increase prosperity levels at city level. It is an initiative that provides
collaborative solutions to the most fundamental challenges facing cities.



Specifically,
it is an Initiative of 250 cities globally that are committed to a more
holistic, people-centred and sustainable notion of prosperity and pledge to
deploy necessary efforts and resources to move forward in the prosperity path
will be created. The aim is to enable a shift away from prevailing narrow and
lopsided conceptualizations of prosperity and related policies and actions. The
rationale for this is that without a new and revised conceptualization of
prosperity at strategic policy levels, cities risk promoting strategies that
threaten rather than enhance sustainability.



By
estimating the City Prosperity Index (CPI) of cities based on globally
comparable data, UN-Habitat will create an invaluable baseline for tracking
progress in terms of prosperity. In addition, in conducting estimations in
cities through the Initiative, UN-Habitat will also adapt the CPI to correspond
to locally available data, policy priorities and needs. Thus, the Initiative
will enable globally comparable yet locally specific estimation and monitoring
of urban prosperity.



Three intermediate accomplishments of the Cities
Prosperity Initiative will be:

Improved policies and strategies of cities towards prosperity path
     are catalyzed through customised action plans.Cities begin to implement actions and policies to advance on a
     prosperity path based on a customised action plan. Cities have enhanced capacity to measure and monitor present and
     future progress towards the prosperity path.



At a more local level, the Cities
Prosperity Initiative aims at:

Reinforcing local capacities to increase economies of scale and
     agglomeration for improved wellbeing and prosperity through localized
     urban planning and design interventions.Assisting in implementing a variety of technical solutions for
     improving the functionality of the city and achieving sustainable urban
     form.Assisting in packaging projects through pre-feasibility studies and
     project viability for financing.

Technical Advisory Package offered by UN-Habitat through the Initiative are

Following from the above, the expected outputs of the project are as follows:

1.Cities create
conditions to embark on actions and policies to advance in a path of prosperity

2.Cities begin
to implement actions and policies to advance in a path of prosperity based on a
tailored General Action Plan and related Road Map

3.Cities are
capable to monitor, measure and evaluate progress towards the prosperity path

The
City Prosperity Index, together with a conceptual matrix, the Wheel of
Prosperity, both of which are meant to facilitate designing of clear policy
interventions, will form the basis of the technical advisory package described
above. This is accompanied by additional technical support in a wide spectrum
of areas such as institutional analysis, strategic thinking, guidelines,
training and capacity development, monitoring tools, urban futures analysis,
and policy simulations all designed to help cities to advance on the prosperity
path in a more sustainable manner. 



UN-Habitat's
wheel of prosperity symbolizes the well-balanced development of the five
dimensions, the current condition of which is graphically represented in the
City Prosperity Index. The outer rim absorbs the cumulative forces transmitted
through the spokes the five dimensions of prosperity. At the centre is the hub
the local urban power functions, with four interrelated roles: ensuring the
prevalence of public over any other kind of interest; controlling the
direction, pace and momentum of the wheel; ensuring the balanced development of
the five spokes and associated synergies; and in a two-way relationship,
absorbing and amortizing any shocks transmitted by the spokes.







The
hub brings together the power functions (e.g., laws, regulations and
institutions, urban planning, civil society, trade associations, special
agencies, etc.) associated with the five spokes. In this role the hub
represents human agency in all its embodiments. Clearly therefore, the thematic
focus of the project is directly linked to and integrates all of UN-Habitat's
thematic priorities as symbolized by its 7 Branches. The operationalization of
the Cities Prosperity Initiative will involve all Branches of UN-Habitat given
the direct linkages between the five dimensions of the Wheel of Urban
Prosperity (productivity, urban infrastructure, quality of life, equity and
environmental sustainability) and ongoing work in UN-Habitat's thematic
Branches. Once the CPI is estimated for cities, UN-Habitat's Branches
will be fully engaged in the roll out of the Technical Advisory Package (see above)
especially in the diagnosis of prosperity challenges and opportunities to
prepare a general action plan and road map; identification of appropriate
innovative solutions, best practices, tools and guides to facilitate
operationalization of the general action plan and road map; and technical
advisory services to support the establishment of local monitoring mechanisms
to track progress on a path of prosperity. 



In
addition, UN-Habitat's regional offices and Habitat Programme Managers will
play a critical role in the operationalization of the Cities Prosperity
Initiative and related activities. Accordingly, using seed funding obtained
from the UN-Habitat Internal Development Fund, the recruitment of three
consultants to be located in UN-Habitat offices in Africa, Asia and Latin
America is already underway.



A
number of external partners will also play a critical role in the realization
of the objectives of the City Prosperity Initiative. These include local and
metropolitan authorities, urban development authorities, local and regional
academic, policy and research institutes, national and regional banks and
Habitat Professionals Associations. Furthermore, where available, UN-Habitat
will rely on Local Urban Observatories (LOUs) for gathering and processing data
for the estimation of CPIs. Moreover, LUOs will be used as a platform for
establishing specific prosperity monitoring mechanism for in each city.  ",2,2013-04-25,2015-12-31,,,,,,,GUADALAJARA,,,,,,,,,,,,MX,Mexico,100,489,"South America, regional",,43082,Research/scientific institutions,,OECD Development Assistance Committee,DAC,1,110,20,CO1,CO1

WOPs are based on the observation that capacity building and retention, facilitated by networking and mentoring, can equip operators to meet the challenges facing the sector. It also draws on the fact that much of the innovation and expertise to address water operators' challenges reside with operators themselves, and that a growing number of these successful operators are highly motivated to share their expertise and innovation with others as â€œmentorsâ€ on a not-for-profit basis. 

The Boosting Effectiveness in WOPs (BEWOP) project aims to address a potential shortcoming of the WOPs approach: while operators are uniquely placed to share their practical experience and technical expertise with their peers, they are rarely experienced in managing a capacity development process.

-	Améliorer les conditions de vie, réduire la vulnérabilité, et préserver la dignité des personnes et communautés affectées par les crises ;
-	Restaurer les moyens de subsistance et renforcer la résilience des communautés affectées par la crise et faciliter le retour et la réintégration durable des populations déplacées et refugiées.

Les déplacés, les rapatriés, les retournés  sont une catégorie des personnes qui sont en premier lieu victimes des violations des droits d'accès à la terre.

Les autorités coutumières sont membres de 2 comités des sages dans les 2 axes d'intervention, qui contribuent à la résolution des conflits fonciers  autour des CLPC et d'autres structures locales de résolution des conflits à la base.

of infrastructure projects and service interventions, taking into account the
impact on and connections with surrounding networks. 

Output 2: Environmental

Following the July 2006 Israeli war, UN-Habitat Lebanon implemented a project titled “Good governance for enhanced post-war reconstruction in South Lebanon” which aimed at enhancing the capacities of affected families and municipalities to better manage the reconstruction process. Within this project, three Regional Technical Offices (RTOs) were established in three targeted Unions of Municipalities (UoMs); Tyre, Bint Jbeil and Jabal Amel. The RTO's engineers and field officers, being part of the local communities, were able, in a short period of time, to mobilize and immediately provide assistance to affected families as well as to concerned municipalities. By assisting the municipalities with rapid technical assessments of the buildings needing reconstruction work, and providing information and guidelines for house owners with ABCs in repair work, the RTOs contributed to a broad and swift rehabilitation process with the local actors at the steering wheel. 


Based on the previous experience UN-Habitat now replicates the RTO model to support the efforts of providing shelter and services for Syrian refugees as well as meeting the needs of the house communities, by enhancing the role of local authorities. In the first pilot phase two RTOs will be established under the mandate of two Unions of Municipalities within the Saida/Zahrani and Chouf districts. After the pilot RTOs are put in place and anticipated system and mechanisms tested, the approach will be applied in more Unions with further geographical outreach. The aim is to establish a model that could work within all Unions of Municipalities in Lebanon, covering more than 800 of the 1000 Municipalities in the country. To ensure that the project is able to rapidly apply the model in new Unions, a second batch of another three Unions of Municipalities is identified. 
This proposed Project, with a focus on enhancing the involvement of municipalities in responding to the needs of Syrian refugees, would i) complement the efforts of the Government, UNHCR, and other UN, national and international agencies, ii) accelerate the assistance process addressed to refugees, and iii) reduce the tension between host communities and refugees.The goal of the project is to respond to the immediate needs of Syrian refugees and host communities in different areas of Lebanon while laying the foundation for medium and long term sustainable solutions. 

In line with the project goal, the proposed action is planned to achieve two main objectives: 
- Accelerate the accommodation process of refugee families through the active involvement of municipalities and unions of municipalities in identifying, assessing and facilitating sound shelter facilities that comply with UNHCR standards and norms. 

- Support host communities through the implementation of sound projects that would respond to community groups needs and would enhance the delivery of basic urban services taking into account the existing and forthcoming numbers of refugees.


The strategy would include the following:
At the national level, UN-Habitat has been coordinating and will continue collaboration with UNHCR, the Ministry of Social Affairs (MoSA), the Ministry of Interior and Municipalities (MoIM) and other concerned governmental institutions and International agencies. This is being done through taking part in donor meetings as well as working groups, mainly shelter and WASH, and inter-agency meetings.
At the regional levels, in addition to municipalities and unions of municipalities, bureaus and representatives of government and international and UN agencies would constantly be engaged in the project processes, notably the Qaimmaqams (Heads of district/Caza leading the regional security cells), UNHCR and other international agencies regional offices. The project will also collaborate and complement on-going and recent UN initiatives in the targeted areas dealing with issues related to Syrian refugees.


The project will set up a model whereby unions of municipalities, municipalities, and communities are actively and constantly engaged in responding to the needs of the Syrian refugees. Partnerships with key local actors represent a core value for this project. The involvement of local actors will prevent possible bottleneck situations in the response, as it will not be limited to agencies already concerned with overstretched capacities.

The
present project is expected to provide the LGUs of Tacloban, Ormoc and Guiuan a
critical head-start to formulating appropriate Recovery and Rehabilitation
Plans, formulated through collaboration and consultation and based on
appropriate technical advice. UN-Habitat and UNDP recognize that both in
Tacloban and Guiuan, the process of moving from the establishment of
coordination and planning commitments and mechanisms for the recovery and
rehabilitation to a functioning capacity to plan and implement requires critical
early support interventions: 

·
Shelter and settlement recovery needs assessments and mapping,
reflecting the new realities of displacement, tenure insecurity, hosting, use
of space for temporary versus durable sheltering and other needs, gradual
services recovery.

·
City and settlement recovery multi-hazard reviews and
vulnerability/resilience assessment

·
City Land Use Plan reviews incorporating critical recovery issues, risk
reduction and adaptation

·
Policies and ordinances providing guidance to the recovery process and
programmes based on the recovery and rehabilitation plans. 



“Recovery
and Sustainable Development Working Groups” have been established in Tacloban
and Guiuan and are co-led by the Local Governments and UN-Habitat. These groups
address priority areas within the local planning framework along the following
entry points: Social Development, Shelter, Economy, Environment, Infrastructure
(and Governance).

The
Working Groups provide an ideal framework for the LGUs to take control of the
recovery and rehabilitation planning while integrating the valuable work done
by the Humanitarian agencies through the cluster system. UN-Habitat as co-lead
and partner in the cluster system is well places to further facilitate this
integration.

Furthermore,
it has been a challenge for most LGUs to relate emergency response actions with
the medium and longer term development aspects of the locality which as
mandated are embodied in their Comprehensive Land Use Plans. This project
therefore likewise intends address such issue by building capacities of target
LGUs to link emergency and early recovery actions with the general development
directions of their localities through technical advisory support and other
relevant activities. The said initiatives would be crucial for the LGUs so that
their proper bodies can appropriately define and/or amend policy issues as well
as programme human and financial resources available in their respective local
governments towards making actions more sustainable.

programmes based on the recovery and rehabilitation plans. 



“Recovery
and Sustainable Development Working Groups” have been established in Tacloban
and Guiuan and are co-led by the Local Governments and UN-Habitat. These groups
address priority areas within the local planning framework along the following
entry points: Social Development, Shelter, Economy, Environment, Infrastructure
(and Governance).

The
Working Groups provide an ideal framework for the LGUs to take control of the
recovery and rehabilitation planning while integrating the valuable work done
by the Humanitarian agencies through the cluster system. UN-Habitat as co-lead
and partner in the cluster system is well places to further facilitate this
integration.

Furthermore,
it has been a challenge for most LGUs to relate emergency response actions with
the medium and longer term development aspects of the locality which as
mandated are embodied in their Comprehensive Land Use Plans. This project
therefore likewise intends address such issue by building capacities of target
LGUs to link emergency and early recovery actions with the general development
directions of their localities through technical advisory support and other
relevant activities. The said initiatives would be crucial for the LGUs so that
their proper bodies can appropriately define and/or amend policy issues as well
as programme human and financial resources available in their respective local
governments towards making actions more sustainable.

It
is clear that there is an urgent need to address the challenges that Somalia
faces regarding the lack of functioning economic infrastructure, service
provision, loss of social cohesion and chances for positive interactions among
the communities as well as the serious lack of sustainable economic
opportunities for marginalized and vulnerable groups, especially women and
youth. 

In
Mogadishu, where informal urbanization is advancing fast, priority should be
given to public spaces, particularly those focused around economic
infrastructure and trading hubs, as a critical city component for economic
growth, and as a driver of social cohesion where different collectivities can
meet and interact. The creation of such spaces for common use has the potential
not only to improve living conditions and public well-being, but also act as a
catalyst for the development of economic activity, private sector development,
sustainable livelihood opportunities and job creation for the increasingly
present urban poor. The systematic and holistic development of public spaces is
a major element contributing to ensuring the development of the local economy
and ensuring that growth is inclusive. 



Many previous and on-going
projects in Somalia have focussed on cash-for-work programmes and short-term
employment opportunities. UN-Habitat's extensive expertise in the fields of
sustainable employment creation in Somalia, as well as upgrading public spaces
and creating respective management systems, puts the organisation in an unique
position to significantly contribute to filling the current gap in Mogadishu's
economy and social wellness. The project aims to create public places that also
serve as economic hubs for the generation of sustainable job opportunities, whilst
also contributing to the fostering of people-to people contacts and therefore
creating an optimal urban environment. This will in turn enhance the quality of
life of Mogadishu's residents, in particular for the urban poor, youth, women,
and persons with disabilities.

of the intervention

The Government of Iraq and the Kurdistan
Regional Government have been jointly responding to the large influx of IDPs
into major Governorates in Iraq. The governments prioritized to mobilize
resources and support to provide appropriate shelters to IDPs, while the United
Nations Humanitarian Coordination Team in Iraq also stressed the importance of
mid-term solution to needs of IDPs, both based on an understanding that security
unrest in Iraq needs to be solved in longer term. Despite the urgency of need
for convenient and durable IDP shelters, the governments have been facing
financial and institutional constraints to respond to large number of IDPs in
Iraq.

Emergency of the situation  

The Islamic State has been expanding its
activities and control in Iraq and Syria. Their adroit media strategy using
internet and social media resulted in increase of numbers of the Islamic State
fighters recruited globally. Despite a series of international intervention
including air campaigns led by the United States, the Islamic State group
continues to expand its territorial control. This situation implies that the
number of IDPs in Iraq and Syria may continue to increase. Some of the major
cities in Iraq already have same number of IDPs as their original population,
and communities hosting IDPs are already under severe pressure with regard to infrastructure and basic services. Therefore,
providing durable shelters to IDPs is an emergency requirement in Iraq.

Unpredictability of the situation

In August 2014, the IS attacks on the
Yazidi community and the Christian minorities in northern Iraq triggered the
internal displacement of some 800,000 persons into three governorates of the
KRI, namely Dohuk, Erbil and Sulaymaniyah. Within a month between August and
September 2014, the number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) more than
quintupled from 96,000 to 520,000 in Dohuk, and increased by 150 per cent from
117,000 to 170,000 in Erbil.
Such exponential increase of
IDPs in Iraq is mainly due to emergence of the extremists group called itself
the Islamic State and the resulting deterioration of security, which became a
serious concern only recently and was not predictable.

Non-Substitutability of the intervention

Provision of prefabricated durable shelters
to IDPs is the most suitable solution that addresses challenges faced by IDPs
and host communities. Continuing to provide tents without basic services is not
a feasible solution in medium term, because tents are not designed to last for
the long period and have to be replaced every eight months. It is also not
suitable to accommodate IDPs during the winter or extreme weather conditions in
summer. Lack of basic infrastructure such as water, latrines, sanitation and
electricity in the camp site will lead to cause more problems among the IDPs
and host communities. Both the governments and international agencies have
